We permute the contents of ARGV as we scan,\n   so that eventually all the non-options are at the end.  This allows options\n   to be given in any order, even with programs that were not written to\n   expect this.\n\n   RETURN_IN_ORDER is an option available to programs that were written\n   to expect options and other ARGV-elements in any order and that care about\n   the ordering of the two.  We describe each non-option ARGV-element\n   as if it were the argument of an option with character code 1.\n   Using `-' as the first character of the list of option characters\n   selects this mode of operation.\n\n   The special argument `--' forces an end of option-scanning regardless\n   of the value of `ordering'.  In the case of RETURN_IN_ORDER, only\n   `--' can cause `getopt' to return EOF with `optind' != ARGC.  "

If you set `opterr' to\n   zero, the error message is suppressed but we still return '?'.\n\n   If a char in OPTSTRING is followed by a colon, that means it wants an arg,\n   so the following text in the same ARGV-element, or the text of the following\n   ARGV-element, is returned in `optarg'.  Two colons mean an option that\n   wants an optional arg; if there is text in the current ARGV-element,\n   it is returned in `optarg', otherwise `optarg' is set to zero.\n\n   If OPTSTRING starts with `-' or `+', it requests different methods of\n   handling the non-option ARGV-elements.\n   See the comments about RETURN_IN_ORDER and REQUIRE_ORDER, above.\n\n   Long-named options begin with `--' instead of `-'.\n   Their names may be abbreviated as long as the abbreviation is unique\n   or is an exact match for some defined option.
