Qualify the filename so that DosQueryAppType does not do extraneous\n * searches.\n * \n * 2. DosQueryAppType will return FAPPTYP_DOS on a file ending with \".com\"\n * (other than an OS/2 exe or Win exe with this name). Eberhard Mattes\n * remarks Tue, 6 Apr 93: Moreover, it reports the type of the (new and very\n * bug ridden) Win Emacs as \"OS/2 executable\".\n * \n * 3. apptype() uses the filename if given, otherwise a tmp file is created with\n * the contents of buf. If buf is not the complete file, apptype can\n * incorrectly identify the exe type. The \"-z\" option of \"file\" is the reason\n * for this ugly code.\n "

Then\nthe buffer can have a shorter length. But what? If you really need to write\nHUGE string, don't use printf!\nDuring the process, some other memory is allocated (1024 bytes minimum)\nto handle the output of partial sprintf() calls. If you have only 10000 bytes\nfree in memory, you *may* not be able to nprintf() a 8000 bytes-long text.\n\nnote: if a buffer overflow occurs, exit() is called. This situation should\nnever appear ... but if you want to be *really* sure, you have to modify the\ncode to handle those situations (only one place to modify).\nA buffer overflow can only occur if your sprintf() do strange things or when\nyou use strange formats.\n\n"

On most systems, this would mean that any\n * file consisting only of characters in the range 0x00 ... 0x7F\n * would be called ASCII text, but many systems might reasonably\n * consider some characters outside this range to be alphabetic,\n * so the file command would call such characters ASCII.  It might\n * have been more accurate to call this \"considered textual on the\n * local system\" than \"ASCII.\"\n *\n * It considered a file to be \"International language text\" if each\n * of its characters was either an ASCII printing character (according\n * to the real ASCII standard, not the above test), a character in\n * the range 0x80 ... 0xFF, or one of the following control characters:\n * backspace, tab, line feed, vertical tab, form feed, carriage return,\n * escape.  No attempt was made to determine the language in which files\n * of this type were written.\n *\n *\n * The table below considers a file to be ASCII if all of its characters\n * are either ASCII printing characters (again, according to the X3.4\n * standard, not isascii()) or any of the following controls: bell,\n * backspace, tab, line feed, form feed, carriage return, esc, nextline.\n *\n * I include bell because some programs (particularly shell scripts)\n * use it literally, even though it is rare in normal text.  I exclude\n * vertical tab because it never seems to be used in real text.  I also\n * include, with hesitation, the X3.64/ECMA-43 control nextline (0x85),\n * because that's what the dd EBCDIC->ASCII table maps the EBCDIC newline\n * character to.  It might be more appropriate to include it in the 8859\n * set instead of the ASCII set, but it's got to be included in *something*\n * we recognize or EBCDIC files aren't going to be considered textual.\n * Some old Unix source files use SO/SI (^N/^O) to shift between Greek\n * and Latin characters, so these should possibly be allowed.  But they\n * make a real mess on VT100-style displays if they're not paired properly,\n * so we are probably better off not calling them text.\n *\n * A file is considered to be ISO-8859 text if its characters are all\n * either ASCII, according to the above definition, or printing characters\n * from the ISO-8859 8-bit extension, characters 0xA0 ... 0xFF.\n *\n * Finally, a file is considered to be international text from some other\n * character code if its characters are all either ISO-8859 (according to\n * the above definition) or characters in the range 0x80 ... 0x9F, which\n * ISO-8859 considers to be control characters but the IBM PC and Macintosh\n * consider to be printing characters.\n "

2018/06/19 20:53:26 " I'm not sure if I'm treating the release correctly.  I think\n release should show up in the -l (ie -lgmp5) so we don't want to\n add it in twice.  Is that correct?"
2018/06/19 20:53:26 " Don't check for shared/static.  Everything works.\n This might be a little naive.  We might want to check\n whether the library exists or not.  But this is on\n osf3 & osf4 and I'm not really sure... Just\n implementing what was already the behavior."
2018/06/19 20:53:26 " This code stresses the \"libraries are programs\" paradigm to its\n limits. Maybe even breaks it.  We compile a program, linking it\n against the deplibs as a proxy for the library.  Then we can check\n whether they linked in statically or dynamically with ldd."
2018/06/19 20:53:26 " Error occurred in the first compile.  Let's try to salvage\n the situation: Compile a separate program for each library."

2018/06/19 20:53:26 " The statement above tries to avoid entering an\n endless loop below, in case of cyclic links.\n We might still enter an endless loop, since a link\n loop can be closed while we follow links,\n but so what?"

See the long comment at the top of\n tests/bindir.at for full details."
2018/06/19 20:53:26 " If a -bindir argument was supplied, place the dll there."

This is particularly important on AIX, because we don't\n support having both static and shared libraries enabled at the same\n time on that platform, so we default to a shared-only configuration.\n If a disable-shared tag is given, we'll fallback to a static-only\n configuration.
