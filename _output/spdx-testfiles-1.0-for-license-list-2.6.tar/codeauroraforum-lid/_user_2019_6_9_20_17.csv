Version 1, March 2002 
 
Copyright ©
2002 Affero Inc. 
510 Third Street - Suite 225, San Francisco, CA
94107, USA

This license is a modified version of the GNU General
Public License copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
made with their permission. Section 2(d) has been added to cover use
of software over a computer network.

Everyone is permitted to copy
and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing
it is not allowed.

Preamble

The licenses for most software are
designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By
contrast, the Affero General Public License is intended to guarantee
your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the
software is free for all its users. This Public License applies to
most of Affero's software and to any other program whose authors
commit to using it. (Some other Affero software is covered by the GNU
Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it to your
programs, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to
freedom, not price. This General Public License is designed to make
sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software
(and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source
code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or
use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do
these things.

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions
that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender
the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities
for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify
it.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the
software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.

Also, for
each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that
everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software.
If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its
recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that
any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

Finally, any free program is threatened
constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that
redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent
licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent this,
we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's
free use or not licensed at all.

The precise terms and conditions for
copying, distribution and modification follow.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS
FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

0. This License applies to
any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the
copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this
Affero General Public License. The ""Program"", below, refers to any
such program or work, and a ""work based on the Program"" means either
the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to
say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim
or with modifications and/or translated into another language.
(Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term
""modification"".) Each licensee is addressed as ""you"".

Activities
other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by
this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the
Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered
only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program
(independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that
is true depends on what the Program does.

1. You may copy and
distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive
it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately
publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of
warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and
to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the
Program a copy of this License along with the Program.

You may charge
a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your
option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

2. You may
modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus
forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such
modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided
that you also meet all of these conditions:

     a) You must cause
the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed
the files and the date of any change. 

     b) You must cause any
work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains
or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as
a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this
License. 

     c) If the modified program normally reads commands
interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running for
such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice
that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a
warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these
conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.
(Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally
print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not
required to print an announcement.) 

     d) If the Program as you
received it is intended to interact with users through a computer
network and if, in the version you received, any user interacting with
the Program was given the opportunity to request transmission to that
user of the Program's complete source code, you must not remove that
facility from your modified version of the Program or work based on
the Program, and must offer an equivalent opportunity for all users
interacting with your Program through a computer network to request
immediate transmission by HTTP of the complete source code of your
modified version or other derivative work.

These requirements apply
to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work
are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably considered
independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and
its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as
separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a
whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the
whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for
other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every
part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this
section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written
entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to
control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on
the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based
on the Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program)
on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the
other work under the scope of this License.

3. You may copy and
distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section 2) in
object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2
above provided that you also do one of the following: 

     a)
Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source
code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2
above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or, 

  
  b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of
physically performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable
copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the
terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for
software interchange; or, 

     c) Accompany it with the information
you received as to the offer to distribute corresponding source code.
(This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and
only if you received the program in object code or executable form
with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

The source
code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code
means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or
object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated
place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from
the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though
third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the
object code.

4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute
the Program except as expressly provided under this License. Any
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the
Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights,
from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so
long as such parties remain in full compliance.

5. You are not
required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.
However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute
the Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by
law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or
distributing the Program (or any work based on the Program), you
indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms
and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program or
works based on it.

6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any
work based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a
license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the
Program subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any
further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted
herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third
parties to this License.

7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment
or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not
limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by
court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of
this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this
License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your
obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations,
then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all. For
example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free
redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly
or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it
and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the
Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or
unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the
section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to
apply in other circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section
to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims
or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole
purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution
system, which is implemented by public license practices. Many people
have made generous contributions to the wide range of software
distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application
of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is
willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee
cannot impose that choice.

This section is intended to make
thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of
this License.

8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is
restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted
interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program under
this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation
excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in
or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License
incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this
License.

9. Affero Inc. may publish revised and/or new versions of
the Affero General Public License from time to time. Such new versions
will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in
detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a
distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies a version
number of this License which applies to it and ""any later version"",
you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
that version or of any later version published by Affero, Inc. If the
Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may
choose any version ever published by Affero, Inc.

You may also choose
to redistribute modified versions of this program under any version of
the Free Software Foundation's GNU General Public License version 3 or
higher, so long as that version of the GNU GPL includes terms and
conditions substantially equivalent to those of this license.

10. If
you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs
whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to
ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by Affero, Inc.,
write to us; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will
be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all
derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and
reuse of software generally.

NO WARRANTY

11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS
LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE
EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN
WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM
""AS IS"" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK
AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD
THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY
SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY
APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR
ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS
PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL,
SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR
INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR
THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

wish with source code distributed with ANTLR or the code generated by
ANTLR, including the incorporation of ANTLR, or its output, into
commerical software.

We encourage users to develop software with
ANTLR. However, we do ask that credit is given to us for developing
ANTLR. By ""credit"", we mean that if you use ANTLR or incorporate any
source code into one of your programs (commercial product, research

documentation, research report, etc... If you like ANTLR and have
developed a nice tool with the output, please mention that you
developed it using ANTLR. In addition, we ask that the headers remain

expect to continue enhancing this system and expect to make other

Copyright
(C) 1994, 1995, 1997, 1998, 1999 Aladdin Enterprises, 
Menlo Park,
California, U.S.A. All rights reserved.

NOTE: This License is not the
same as any of the GNU Licenses published by the Free Software
Foundation. Its terms are substantially different from those of the
GNU Licenses. If you are familiar with the GNU Licenses, please read
this license with extra care.

Aladdin Enterprises hereby grants to
anyone the permission to apply this License to their own work, as long
as the entire License (including the above notices and this paragraph)
is copied with no changes, additions, or deletions except for changing
the first paragraph of Section 0 to include a suitable description of
the work to which the license is being applied and of the person or
entity that holds the copyright in the work, and, if the License is
being applied to a work created in a country other than the United
States, replacing the first paragraph of Section 6 with an appropriate
reference to the laws of the appropriate country.

0. Subject
Matter
This License applies to the computer program known as ""Aladdin
Ghostscript."" The ""Program"", below, refers to such program. The
Program is a copyrighted work whose copyright is held by Aladdin
Enterprises (the ""Licensor""). Please note that Aladdin Ghostscript is
neither the program known as ""GNU Ghostscript"" nor the version of
Ghostscript available for commercial licensing from Artifex Software
Inc.

A ""work based on the Program"" means either the Program or any
derivative work of the Program, as defined in the United States
Copyright Act of 1976, such as a translation or a modification.

BY
MODIFYING OR DISTRIBUTING THE PROGRAM (OR ANY WORK BASED ON THE
PROGRAM), YOU INDICATE YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THIS LICENSE TO DO SO, AND
ALL ITS TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTING OR MODIFYING
THE PROGRAM OR WORKS BASED ON IT. NOTHING OTHER THAN THIS LICENSE
GRANTS YOU PERMISSION TO MODIFY OR DISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM OR ITS
DERIVATIVE WORKS. THESE ACTIONS ARE PROHIBITED BY LAW. IF YOU DO NOT
ACCEPT THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, DO NOT MODIFY OR DISTRIBUTE THE
PROGRAM.

1. Licenses.
Licensor hereby grants you the following
rights, provided that you comply with all of the restrictions set
forth in this License and provided, further, that you distribute an
unmodified copy of this License with the Program:

     (a) You may
copy and distribute literal (i.e., verbatim) copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it throughout the world, in any medium.
   
 (b) You may modify the Program, create works based on the Program and
distribute copies of such throughout the world, in any medium.

2.
Restrictions.
This license is subject to the following restrictions:


    (a) Distribution of the Program or any work based on the Program
by a commercial organization to any third party is prohibited if any
payment is made in connection with such distribution, whether directly
(as in payment for a copy of the Program) or indirectly (as in payment
for some service related to the Program, or payment for some product
or service that includes a copy of the Program ""without charge""; these
are only examples, and not an exhaustive enumeration of prohibited
activities). The following methods of distribution involving payment
shall not in and of themselves be a violation of this restriction:

  
       (i) Posting the Program on a public access information storage
and retrieval service for which a fee is received for retrieving
information (such as an on-line service), provided that the fee is not
content-dependent (i.e., the fee would be the same for retrieving the
same volume of information consisting of random data) and that access
to the service and to the Program is available independent of any
other product or service. An example of a service that does not fall
under this section is an on-line service that is operated by a company
and that is only available to customers of that company. (This is not
an exhaustive enumeration.)
          (ii) Distributing the Program on
removable computer-readable media, provided that the files containing
the Program are reproduced entirely and verbatim on such media, that
all information on such media be redistributable for non-commercial
purposes without charge, and that such media are distributed by
themselves (except for accompanying documentation) independent of any
other product or service. Examples of such media include CD-ROM,
magnetic tape, and optical storage media. (This is not intended to be
an exhaustive list.) An example of a distribution that does not fall
under this section is a CD-ROM included in a book or magazine. (This
is not an exhaustive enumeration.)

     (b) Activities other than
copying, distribution and modification of the Program are not subject
to this License and they are outside its scope. Functional use
(running) of the Program is not restricted, and any output produced
through the use of the Program is subject to this license only if its
contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having
been made by running the Program).

     (c) You must meet all of the
following conditions with respect to any work that you distribute or
publish that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the
Program or any part thereof (""the Work""):

          (i) If you have
modified the Program, you must cause the Work to carry prominent
notices stating that you have modified the Program's files and the
date of any change. In each source file that you have modified, you
must include a prominent notice that you have modified the file,
including your name, your e-mail address (if any), and the date and
purpose of the change;
          (ii) You must cause the Work to be
licensed as a whole and at no charge to all third parties under the
terms of this License;
          (iii) If the Work normally reads
commands interactively when run, you must cause it, at each time the
Work commences operation, to print or display an announcement
including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is
no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty). Such notice
must also state that users may redistribute the Work only under the
conditions of this License and tell the user how to view the copy of
this License included with the Work. (Exceptions: if the Program is
interactive but normally prints or displays such an announcement only
at the request of a user, such as in an ""About box"", the Work is
required to print or display the notice only under the same
circumstances; if the Program itself is interactive but does not
normally print such an announcement, the Work is not required to print
an announcement.);
          (iv) You must accompany the Work with the
complete corresponding machine-readable source code, delivered on a
medium customarily used for software interchange. The source code for
a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications
to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all the
source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface
definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and
installation of the executable code. If you distribute with the Work
any component that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, you must also
distribute the source code of that component if you have it and are
allowed to do so;
          (v) If you distribute any written or
printed material at all with the Work, such material must include
either a written copy of this License, or a prominent written
indication that the Work is covered by this License and written
instructions for printing and/or displaying the copy of the License on
the distribution medium;
          (vi) You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipient's exercise of the rights granted
herein.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by
offering the equivalent ability to copy from a designated place, then
offering equivalent ability to copy the source code from the same
place counts as distribution of the source code, even though third
parties are not compelled to copy the source code along with the
object code.

3. Reservation of Rights.
No rights are granted to the
Program except as expressly set forth herein. You may not copy,
modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly
provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify,
sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically
terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have
received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have
their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full
compliance.

4. Other Restrictions.
If the distribution and/or use of
the Program is restricted in certain countries for any reason,
Licensor may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation
excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in
or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License
incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this
License.

5. Limitations.
THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED TO YOU ""AS IS,""
WITHOUT WARRANTY. THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, EITHER
EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND
NONINFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE
QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM
PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW
OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL LICENSOR, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY
MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE
TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES.

6. General.
This License is governed by the laws of the
State of California, U.S.A., excluding choice of law rules.

If any
part of this License is found to be in conflict with the law, that
part shall be interpreted in its broadest meaning consistent with the
law, and no other parts of the License shall be affected.

For United
States Government users, the Program is provided with RESTRICTED
RIGHTS. If you are a unit or agency of the United States Government or
are acquiring the Program for any such unit or agency, the following
apply:

If the unit or agency is the Department of Defense (""DOD""),
the Program and its documentation are classified as ""commercial
computer software"" and ""commercial computer software documentation""
respectively and, pursuant to DFAR Section 227.7202, the Government is
acquiring the Program and its documentation in accordance with the
terms of this License. If the unit or agency is other than DOD, the
Program and its documentation are classified as ""commercial computer
software"" and ""commercial computer software documentation""
respectively and, pursuant to FAR Section 12.212, the Government is
acquiring the Program and its documentation in accordance with the
terms of this License.

Preamble

The intent of this document is to
state the conditions under which a Package may be copied, such that
the Copyright Holder maintains some semblance of artistic control over
the development of the package, while giving the users of the package
the right to use and distribute the Package in a more-or-less
customary fashion, plus the right to make reasonable
modifications.

Definitions:

     ""Package"" refers to the collection
of files distributed by the Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that
collection of files created through textual modification.

    
""Standard Version"" refers to such a Package if it has not been
modified, or has been modified in accordance with the wishes of the
Copyright Holder as specified below.

     ""Copyright Holder"" is
whoever is named in the copyright or copyrights for the package.

    
""You"" is you, if you're thinking about copying or distributing this
Package.

     ""Reasonable copying fee"" is whatever you can justify on
the basis of media cost, duplication charges, time of people involved,
and so on.  (You will not be required to justify it to the Copyright
Holder, but only to the computing community at large as a market that
must bear the fee.)

     ""Freely Available"" means that no fee is
charged for the item itself, though there may be fees involved in
handling the item. It also means that recipients of the item may
redistribute it under the same conditions they received it.

1. You
may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the
Standard Version of this Package without restriction, provided that
you duplicate all of the original copyright notices and associated
disclaimers.

2. You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other
modifications derived from the Public Domain or from the Copyright
Holder.  A Package modified in such a way shall still be considered
the Standard Version.

3. You may otherwise modify your copy of this
Package in any way, provided that you insert a prominent notice in
each changed file stating how and when you changed that file, and
provided that you do at least ONE of the following:

     a) place
your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make them Freely
Available, such as by posting said modifications to Usenet or an
equivalent medium, or placing the modifications on a major archive
site such as uunet.uu.net, or by allowing the Copyright Holder to
include your modifications in the Standard Version of the Package.
   
 b) use the modified Package only within your corporation or
organization.
     c) rename any non-standard executables so the names
do not conflict with standard executables, which must also be
provided, and provide a separate manual page for each non-standard
executable that clearly documents how it differs from the Standard
Version.
     d) make other distribution arrangements with the
Copyright Holder.

4. You may distribute the programs of this Package
in object code or executable form, provided that you do at least ONE
of the following:

     a) distribute a Standard Version of the
executables and library files, together with instructions (in the
manual page or equivalent) on where to get the Standard Version.
    
b) accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of the
Package with your modifications.
     c) give non-standard executables
non-standard names, and clearly document the differences in manual
pages (or equivalent), together with instructions on where to get the
Standard Version.
     d) make other distribution arrangements with
the Copyright Holder.

5. You may charge a reasonable copying fee for
any distribution of this Package.  You may charge any fee you choose
for support of this Package.  You may not charge a fee for this
Package itself.  However, you may distribute this Package in aggregate
with other (possibly commercial) programs as part of a larger
(possibly commercial) software distribution provided that you do not
advertise this Package as a product of your own.  You may embed this
Package's interpreter within an executable of yours (by linking); this
shall be construed as a mere form of aggregation, provided that the
complete Standard Version of the interpreter is so embedded.

6. The
scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as output
from the programs of this Package do not automatically fall under the
copyright of this Package, but belong to whoever generated them, and
may be sold commercially, and may be aggregated with this Package.  If
such scripts or library files are aggregated with this Package via the
so-called ""undump"" or ""unexec"" methods of producing a binary
executable image, then distribution of such an image shall neither be
construed as a distribution of this Package nor shall it fall under
the restrictions of Paragraphs 3 and 4, provided that you do not
represent such an executable image as a Standard Version of this
Package.

7. C subroutines (or comparably compiled subroutines in
other languages) supplied by you and linked into this Package in order
to emulate subroutines and variables of the language defined by this
Package shall not be considered part of this Package, but are the
equivalent of input as in Paragraph 6, provided these subroutines do
not change the language in any way that would cause it to fail the
regression tests for the language.

8. Aggregation of this Package
with a commercial distribution is always permitted provided that the
use of this Package is embedded; that is, when no overt attempt is
made to make this Package's interfaces visible to the end user of the
commercial distribution.  Such use shall not be construed as a
distribution of this Package.

9. The name of the Copyright Holder may
not be used to endorse or promote products derived from this software
without specific prior written permission.

10. THIS PACKAGE IS
PROVIDED ""AS IS"" AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES,
INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTIBILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Copyright (c) 2000-2006, The Perl
Foundation.

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim
copies of this license document, but changing it is not
allowed.

Preamble

This license establishes the terms under which a
given free software Package may be copied, modified, distributed,
and/or redistributed. The intent is that the Copyright Holder
maintains some artistic control over the development of that Package
while still keeping the Package available as open source and free
software.

You are always permitted to make arrangements wholly
outside of this license directly with the Copyright Holder of a given
Package.  If the terms of this license do not permit the full use that
you propose to make of the Package, you should contact the Copyright
Holder and seek a different licensing arrangement. 

Definitions

    
""Copyright Holder"" means the individual(s) or organization(s) named in
the copyright notice for the entire Package.

     ""Contributor"" means
any party that has contributed code or other material to the Package,
in accordance with the Copyright Holder's procedures.

     ""You"" and
""your"" means any person who would like to copy, distribute, or modify
the Package.

     ""Package"" means the collection of files distributed
by the Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection and/or of
those files. A given Package may consist of either the Standard
Version, or a Modified Version.

     ""Distribute"" means providing a
copy of the Package or making it accessible to anyone else, or in the
case of a company or organization, to others outside of your company
or organization.

     ""Distributor Fee"" means any fee that you charge
for Distributing this Package or providing support for this Package to
another party.  It does not mean licensing fees.

     ""Standard
Version"" refers to the Package if it has not been modified, or has
been modified only in ways explicitly requested by the Copyright
Holder.

     ""Modified Version"" means the Package, if it has been
changed, and such changes were not explicitly requested by the
Copyright Holder. 

     ""Original License"" means this Artistic
License as Distributed with the Standard Version of the Package, in
its current version or as it may be modified by The Perl Foundation in
the future.

     ""Source"" form means the source code, documentation
source, and configuration files for the Package.

     ""Compiled"" form
means the compiled bytecode, object code, binary, or any other form
resulting from mechanical transformation or translation of the Source
form.

Permission for Use and Modification Without Distribution

(1)
You are permitted to use the Standard Version and create and use
Modified Versions for any purpose without restriction, provided that
you do not Distribute the Modified Version.

Permissions for
Redistribution of the Standard Version

(2) You may Distribute
verbatim copies of the Source form of the Standard Version of this
Package in any medium without restriction, either gratis or for a
Distributor Fee, provided that you duplicate all of the original
copyright notices and associated disclaimers.  At your discretion,
such verbatim copies may or may not include a Compiled form of the
Package.

(3) You may apply any bug fixes, portability changes, and
other modifications made available from the Copyright Holder.  The
resulting Package will still be considered the Standard Version, and
as such will be subject to the Original License.

Distribution of
Modified Versions of the Package as Source 

(4) You may Distribute
your Modified Version as Source (either gratis or for a Distributor
Fee, and with or without a Compiled form of the Modified Version)
provided that you clearly document how it differs from the Standard
Version, including, but not limited to, documenting any non-standard
features, executables, or modules, and provided that you do at least
ONE of the following:

     (a) make the Modified Version available to
the Copyright Holder of the Standard Version, under the Original
License, so that the Copyright Holder may include your modifications
in the Standard Version.
     (b) ensure that installation of your
Modified Version does not prevent the user installing or running the
Standard Version. In addition, the Modified Version must bear a name
that is different from the name of the Standard Version.
     (c)
allow anyone who receives a copy of the Modified Version to make the
Source form of the Modified Version available to others under

       
  (i) the Original License or
          (ii) a license that permits
the licensee to freely copy, modify and redistribute the Modified
Version using the same licensing terms that apply to the copy that the
licensee received, and requires that the Source form of the Modified
Version, and of any works derived from it, be made freely available in
that license fees are prohibited but Distributor Fees are
allowed.

Distribution of Compiled Forms of the Standard Version or
Modified Versions without the Source

(5)  You may Distribute Compiled
forms of the Standard Version without the Source, provided that you
include complete instructions on how to get the Source of the Standard
Version.  Such instructions must be valid at the time of your
distribution.  If these instructions, at any time while you are
carrying out such distribution, become invalid, you must provide new
instructions on demand or cease further distribution. If you provide
valid instructions or cease distribution within thirty days after you
become aware that the instructions are invalid, then you do not
forfeit any of your rights under this license.

(6)  You may
Distribute a Modified Version in Compiled form without the Source,
provided that you comply with Section 4 with respect to the Source of
the Modified Version.

Aggregating or Linking the Package 

(7)  You
may aggregate the Package (either the Standard Version or Modified
Version) with other packages and Distribute the resulting aggregation
provided that you do not charge a licensing fee for the Package. 
Distributor Fees are permitted, and licensing fees for other
components in the aggregation are permitted. The terms of this license
apply to the use and Distribution of the Standard or Modified Versions
as included in the aggregation.

(8) You are permitted to link
Modified and Standard Versions with other works, to embed the Package
in a larger work of your own, or to build stand-alone binary or
bytecode versions of applications that include the Package, and
Distribute the result without restriction, provided the result does
not expose a direct interface to the Package.

Items That are Not
Considered Part of a Modified Version 

(9) Works (including, but not
limited to, modules and scripts) that merely extend or make use of the
Package, do not, by themselves, cause the Package to be a Modified
Version.  In addition, such works are not considered parts of the
Package itself, and are not subject to the terms of this
license.

General Provisions

(10)  Any use, modification, and
distribution of the Standard or Modified Versions is governed by this
Artistic License. By using, modifying or distributing the Package, you
accept this license. Do not use, modify, or distribute the Package, if
you do not accept this license.

(11)  If your Modified Version has
been derived from a Modified Version made by someone other than you,
you are nevertheless required to ensure that your Modified Version
complies with the requirements of this license.

(12)  This license
does not grant you the right to use any trademark, service mark,
tradename, or logo of the Copyright Holder.

(13)  This license
includes the non-exclusive, worldwide, free-of-charge patent license
to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import and otherwise
transfer the Package with respect to any patent claims licensable by
the Copyright Holder that are necessarily infringed by the Package. If
you institute patent litigation (including a cross-claim or
counterclaim) against any party alleging that the Package constitutes
direct or contributory patent infringement, then this Artistic License
to you shall terminate on the date that such litigation is
filed.

(14)  Disclaimer of Warranty:
THE PACKAGE IS PROVIDED BY THE
COPYRIGHT HOLDER AND CONTRIBUTORS ""AS IS' AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED WARRANTIES. THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS

February 2002

Preamble 
--------

The
Berkeley Software Distribution (""BSD"") license has proven very
effective over the years at allowing for a wide spread of work
throughout both commercial and non-commercial products. For
programmers whose primary intention is to improve the general quality
of available software, it is arguable that there is no better license
than the BSD license, as it permits improvements to be used wherever
they will help, without idealogical or metallic constraint.

This is
of particular value to those who produce reference implementations of
proposed standards: The case of TCP/IP clearly illustrates that freely
and universally available implementations leads the rapid acceptance
of standards -- often even being used instead of a de jure standard
(eg, OSI network models).

With the rapid proliferation of software
licensed under the GNU General Public License, however, the continued
success of this role is called into question. Given that the inclusion
of a few lines of ""GPL-tainted"" work into a larger body of work will
result in restricted distribution -- and given that further work will
likely build upon the ""tainted"" portions, making them difficult to
remove at a future date -- there are inevitable circumstances where
authors would, in order to protect their goal of providing for the
widespread usage of their work, wish to guard against such
""GPL-taint"".

In addition, one can imagine that companies which
operate by producing and selling (possibly closed-source) code would
wish to protect themselves against the rise of a GPL-licensed
competitor. While under existing licenses this would mean not
releasing their code under any form of open license, if a license
existed under which they could incorporate any improvements back into
their own (commercial) products then they might be far more willing to
provide for non-closed distribution.

For the above reasons, we put
forth this ""BSD Protection License"": A license designed to retain the
freedom granted by the BSD license to use licensed works in a wide
variety of settings, both non-commercial and commercial, while
protecting the work from having future contributors restrict that
freedom.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution,
and modification follow.

BSD PROTECTION LICENSE TERMS AND CONDITIONS
FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION, AND MODIFICATION

----------------------------------------------------------------

0.
Definitions. 

     a) ""Program"", below, refers to any program or work
distributed under the terms of this license. 
     b) A ""work based on
the Program"", below, refers to either the Program or any derivative
work under copyright law. 
     c) ""Modification"", below, refers to
the act of creating derivative works. 
     d) ""You"", below, refers to
each licensee.

1. Scope. 
This license governs the copying,
distribution, and modification of the Program. Other activities are
outside the scope of this license; The act of running the Program is
not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its
contents constitute a work based on the Program.

2. Verbatim copies.

You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program as you
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the
absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program
a copy of this License along with the Program.

3. Modification and
redistribution under closed license. 
You may modify your copy or
copies of the Program, and distribute the resulting derivative works,
provided that you meet the following conditions: 

     a) The
copyright notice and disclaimer on the Program must be reproduced and
included in the source code, documentation, and/or other materials
provided in a manner in which such notices are normally distributed. 

    b) The derivative work must be clearly identified as such, in
order that it may not be confused with the original work. 
     c) The
license under which the derivative work is distributed must expressly
prohibit the distribution of further derivative works.

4.
Modification and redistribution under open license. 
You may modify
your copy or copies of the Program, and distribute the resulting
derivative works, provided that you meet the following conditions: 

 
   a) The copyright notice and disclaimer on the Program must be
reproduced and included in the source code, documentation, and/or
other materials provided in a manner in which such notices are
normally distributed. 
     b) You must clearly indicate the nature
and date of any changes made to the Program. The full details need not
necessarily be included in the individual modified files, provided
that each modified file is clearly marked as such and instructions are
included on where the full details of the modifications may be found.

     c) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that
in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
parties under the terms of this License.

5. Implied acceptance. 
You
may not copy or distribute the Program or any derivative works except
as expressly provided under this license. Consequently, any such
action will be taken as implied acceptance of the terms of this
license.

6. NO WARRANTY. 
THIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED ""AS IS"" AND ANY
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY
OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS
PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,
SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR
INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES; LOSS OF USE, DATA, OR
PROFITS; OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION) HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF
LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT, EVEN IF

Version 1.1

PLEASE
READ THIS DOCUMENT CAREFULLY AND IN ITS ENTIRETY. THE ACCOMPANYING
PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS COMPUTER ASSOCIATES
TRUSTED OPEN SOURCE LICENSE (""LICENSE""). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION,
MODIFICATION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES THE
RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS LICENSE.

License Background

Computer
Associates International, Inc. (CA) believes in open source. We
believe that the open source development approach can take appropriate
software programs to unprecedented levels of quality, growth, and
innovation. To demonstrate our continuing commitment to open source,
we are releasing the Program (as defined below) under this
License.

This License is intended to permit contributors and
recipients of the Program to use the Program, including its source
code, freely and without many of the concerns of some other open
source licenses. Although we expect the underlying Program, and
Contributions (as defined below) made to such Program, to remain open,
this License is designed to permit you to maintain your own software
programs free of this License unless you choose to do so. Thus, only
your Contributions to the Program must be distributed under the terms
of this License.

The provisions that follow set forth the terms and
conditions under which you may use the Program.

1. DEFINITIONS

1.1
Contribution means (a) in the case of CA, the Original Program; and
(b) in the case of each Contributor (including CA), changes and
additions to the Program, where such changes and/or additions to the
Program originate from and are distributed by that particular
Contributor to unaffiliated third parties. A Contribution originates
from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor
itself or anyone acting on such Contributors behalf. Contributions do
not include additions to the Program which: (x) are separate modules
of software distributed in conjunction with the Program under their
own license agreement, and (y) are not derivative works of the
Program.

1.2 Contributor means CA and any other person or entity that
distributes the Program.

1.3 Contributor Version means as to a
Contributor, that version of the Program that includes the
Contributors Contribution but not any Contributions made to the
Program thereafter.

1.4 Larger Work means a work that combines the
Program or portions thereof with code not governed by the terms of
this License.

1.5 Licensed Patents mean patents licensable by a
Contributor that are infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution
alone or when combined with the Program.

1.6 Original Program means
the original version of the software to which this License is attached
and as released by CA, including source code, object code and
documentation, if any.

1.7 Program means the Original Program and
Contributions.

1.8 Recipient means anyone who modifies, copies, uses
or distributes the Program.

2. GRANT OF RIGHTS

2.1 Subject to the
terms of this License, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient an
irrevocable, non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to
reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly
perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such
Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and
object code form. For the avoidance of doubt, the license provided in
this Section 2.1 shall not include a license to any Licensed Patents
of a Contributor.

2.2 Subject to the terms of this License, each
Contributor hereby grants Recipient an irrevocable, non-exclusive,
worldwide, royalty-free license to the Licensed Patents to the extent
necessary to make, use, sell, offer to sell and import the
Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object
code form. The license granted in this Section 2.2 shall apply to the
combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the
Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the
Contribution causes the Licensed Patents to be infringed by such
combination. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no license is granted
under this Section 2.2: (a) for any code or works that do not include
the Contributor Version, as it exists and is used in accordance with
the terms hereof; (b) for infringements caused by: (i) third party
modifications of the Contributor Version; or (ii) the combination of
Contributions made by each such Contributor with other software
(except as part of the Contributor Version) or other devices; or (c)
with respect to Licensed Patents infringed by the Program in the
absence of Contributions made by that Contributor.

2.3 Recipient
understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its
Contributions set forth herein, except as provided in Section 2.4, no
assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not
infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other
person or entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to
Recipient for claims brought by any other person or entity based on
infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a
condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder,
each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other
intellectual property rights needed, if any.

2.4 Each Contributor
represents and warrants that it has all right, title and interest in
the copyrights in its Contributions, and has the right to grant the
copyright licenses set forth in this License.

3. DISTRIBUTION
REQUIREMENTS

3.1 If the Program is distributed in object code form,
then a prominent notice must be included in the code itself as well as
in any related documentation, stating that the source code for the
Program is available from the Contributor with information on how and
where to obtain the source code. A Contributor may choose to
distribute the Program in object code form under its own license
agreement, provided that:

     * it complies with the terms and
conditions of this License; and
     * its license agreement:
        
 * effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties
and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or
conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or
conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose, to
the maximum extent permitted by applicable law;
          *
effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for
damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and
consequential damages, such as lost profits, to the maximum extent
permitted by applicable law;
          * states that any provisions
which are inconsistent with this License are offered by that
Contributor alone and not by any other party; and
          * states
that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor at
the cost of distribution, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a
reasonable manner.
   
3.2 When the Program is made available in
source code form:

     * it must be made available under this
License; and
     * a copy of this License must be included with each
copy of the Program.
 
3.3 This License is intended to facilitate the
commercial distribution of the Program by any Contributor. However,
Contributors may only charge Recipients a one-time, upfront fee for
the distribution of the Program. Contributors may not charge
Recipients any recurring charge, license fee, or any ongoing royalty
for the Recipients exercise of its rights under this License to the
Program. Contributors shall make the source code for the Contributor
Version they distribute available at a cost, if any, equal to the cost
to the Contributor to physically copy and distribute the work. It is
not the intent of this License to prohibit a Contributor from charging
fees for any service or maintenance that a Contributor may charge to a
Recipient, so long as such fees are not an attempt to circumvent the
foregoing restrictions on charging royalties or other recurring fees
for the Program itself.

3.4 A Contributor may create a Larger Work by
combining the Program with other software code not governed by the
terms of this License, and distribute the Larger Work as a single
product. In such a case, the Contributor must make sure that the
requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Program. Any
Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering,
including as part of a Larger Work, may subject itself, but not any
other Contributor, to additional contractual commitments, including,
but not limited to, performance warranties and non-infringement
representations on suchContributors behalf. No Contributor may create
any additional liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a
Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering,
such Contributor (Commercial Contributor) hereby agrees to defend and
indemnify every other Contributor (Indemnified Contributor) who made
Contributions to the Program distributed by the Commercial Contributor
against any losses, damages and costs (collectively Losses) arising
from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party
against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts
or omissions, including any additional contractual commitments, of
such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the
Program. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or
Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property
infringement.

3.5 If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a
third partys intellectual property rights is required to exercise the
rights granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2,
Contributor must (a) include a text file with the Program source code
distribution titled ../IP_ISSUES, and (b) notify CA in writing at
Computer Associates International, Inc., One Computer Associates
Plaza, Islandia, New York 11749, Attn: Open Source Group or by email
at opensource@ca.com, both describing the claim and the party making
the claim in sufficient detail that a Recipient and CA will know whom
to contact with regard to such matter. If Contributor obtains such
knowledge after the Contribution is made available, Contributor shall
also promptly modify the IP_ISSUES file in all copies Contributor
makes available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as
notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably
calculated to inform those who received the Program that such new
knowledge has been obtained.

3.6 Recipient shall not remove, obscure,
or modify any CA or other Contributor copyright or patent proprietary
notices appearing in the Program, whether in the source code, object
code or in any documentation. In addition to the obligations set forth
in Section 4, each Contributor must identify itself as the originator
of its Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows
subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the
Contribution.

4. CONTRIBUTION RESTRICTIONS

4.1 Each Contributor must
cause the Program to which the Contributor provides a Contribution to
contain a file documenting the changes the Contributor made to create
its version of the Program and the date of any change. Each
Contributor must also include a prominent statement that the
Contribution is derived, directly or indirectly, from the Program
distributed by a prior Contributor, including the name of the prior
Contributor from which such Contribution was derived, in (a) the
Program source code, and (b) in any notice in an executable version or
related documentation in which the Contributor describes the origin or
ownership of the Program.

5. NO WARRANTY

5.1 EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET
FORTH IN THIS LICENSE, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED AS IS AND IN ITS
PRESENT STATE AND CONDITION. NO WARRANTY, REPRESENTATION, CONDITION,
UNDERTAKING OR TERM, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, AS TO
THE CONDITION, QUALITY, DURABILITY, PERFORMANCE, NON-INFRINGEMENT,
MERCHANTABILITY, OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR USE OF THE
PROGRAM IS GIVEN OR ASSUMED BY ANY CONTRIBUTOR AND ALL SUCH
WARRANTIES, REPRESENTATIONS, CONDITIONS, UNDERTAKINGS AND TERMS ARE
HEREBY EXCLUDED TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.

5.2 Each
Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of
using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated
with its exercise of rights under this License, including but not
limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with
applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and
unavailability or interruption of operations.

5.3 Each Recipient
acknowledges that the Program is not intended for use in the operation
of nuclear facilities, aircraft navigation, communication systems, or
air traffic control machines in which case the failure of the Program
could lead to death, personal injury, or severe physical or
environmental damage.

6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY

6.1 EXCEPT AS
EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS LICENSE, AND TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
LAW, NO CONTRIBUTOR SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT,
INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING
WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF
LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING
NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR
DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED
HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7.
TRADEMARKS AND BRANDING

7.1 This License does not grant any Recipient
or any third party any rights to use the trademarks or trade names now
or subsequently posted at http://www.ca.com/catrdmrk.htm, or any other
trademarks, service marks, logos or trade names belonging to CA
(collectively CA Marks) or to any trademark, service mark, logo or
trade name belonging to any Contributor. Recipient agrees not to use
any CA Marks in or as part of the name of products derived from the
Original Program or to endorse or promote products derived from the
Original Program.

7.2 Subject to Section 7.1, Recipients may
distribute the Program under trademarks, logos, and product names
belonging to the Recipient provided that all copyright and other
attribution notices remain in the Program.

8. PATENT LITIGATION

8.1
If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any person or entity
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other
software or hardware) infringes such Recipients patent(s), then such
Recipients rights granted under Section 2.2 shall terminate as of the
date such litigation is filed.

9. OWNERSHIP

9.1 Subject to the
licenses granted under this License in Sections 2.1 and 2.2 above,
each Contributor retains all rights, title and interest in and to any
Contributions made by such Contributor. CA retains all rights, title
and interest in and to the Original Program and any Contributions made
by or on behalf of CA (CA Contributions), and such CA Contributions
will not be automatically subject to this License. CA may, at its sole
discretion, choose to license such CA Contributions under this
License, or on different terms from those contained in this License or
may choose not to license them at all.

10. TERMINATION

10.1 All of
Recipients rights under this License shall terminate if it fails to
comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this License
and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after
becoming aware of such noncompliance. If Recipients rights under this
License terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of
the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipients
obligations under this License and any licenses granted by Recipient
as a Contributor relating to the Program shall continue and survive
termination.

11. GENERAL

11.1 If any provision of this License is
invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the
validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this
License, and without further action by the parties hereto, such
provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make
such provision valid and enforceable.

11.2 CA may publish new
versions (including revisions) of this License from time to time. Each
new version of the License will be given a distinguishing version
number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be
distributed subject to the version of the License under which it was
received. In addition, after a new version of the License is
published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including
its Contributions) under the new version. No one other than CA has the
right to modify this License.

11.3 If it is impossible for Recipient
to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some
or all of the Program due to statute, judicial order, or regulation,
then Recipient must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the
maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code
they affect. Such description must be included in the IP_ISSUES file
described in Section 3.5 and must be included with all distributions
of the Program source code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute
or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a
Recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.

11.4 This
License is governed by the laws of the State of New York. No Recipient
will bring a legal action under this License more than one year after
the cause of action arose. Each Recipient waives its rights to a jury
trial in any resulting litigation. Any litigation or other dispute
resolution between a Recipient and CA relating to this License shall
take place in the State of New York, and Recipient and CA hereby
consent to the personal jurisdiction of, and venue in, the state and

a work, such as a periodical issue, anthology or encyclopedia, in
which the Work in its entirety in unmodified form, along with a number
of other contributions, constituting separate and independent works in
themselves, are assembled into a collective whole. A work that
constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work
(as defined below) for the purposes of this License.

     b.
""Derivative Work"" means a work based upon the Work or upon the Work
and other pre-existing works, such as a translation, musical
arrangement, dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture version,
sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment, condensation, or any
other form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted,
except that a work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be
considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License.

     c.
""Licensor"" means the individual or entity that offers the Work under
the terms of this License.

     d. ""Original Author"" means the
individual or entity who created the Work.

license is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any rights arising
from fair use, first sale or other limitations on the exclusive rights
of the copyright owner under copyright law or other applicable
laws.

3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
License, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable
copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work as stated
below:

one or more Collective Works, and to reproduce the Work as
incorporated in the Collective Works;

     b. to create and reproduce
Derivative Works;

     c. to distribute copies or phonorecords of,
display publicly, perform publicly, and perform publicly by means of a
digital audio transmission the Work including as incorporated in
Collective Works;

     d. to distribute copies or phonorecords of,
display publicly, perform publicly, and perform publicly by means of a
digital audio transmission Derivative Works;

The above rights may be

devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications
as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and
formats. All rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby
reserved.

4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is
expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:


    a. You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or

to the disclaimer of warranties. You may not distribute, publicly
display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work with
any technological measures that control access or use of the Work in a
manner inconsistent with the terms of this License Agreement. The
above applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collective Work, but
this does not require the Collective Work apart from the Work itself
to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a
Collective Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent
practicable, remove from the Collective Work any reference to such
Licensor or the Original Author, as requested. If You create a
Derivative Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent

however, that in the case of a Derivative Work or Collective Work, at
a minimum such credit will appear where any other comparable
authorship credit appears and in a manner at least as prominent as
such other comparable authorship credit.

publicity rights, common law rights or any other right of any third
party or constitute defamation, invasion of privacy or other tortious

above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for
the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding
the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under
different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time;

be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will
continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated
above.

Work into one or more Collective Works, and to reproduce the Work as
incorporated in the Collective Works;

     b. to create and reproduce
Derivative Works;

     c. to distribute copies or phonorecords of,
display publicly, perform publicly, and perform publicly by means of a
digital audio transmission the Work including as incorporated in
Collective Works;

     d. to distribute copies or phonorecords of,
display publicly, perform publicly, and perform publicly by means of a

     e. For the
avoidance of doubt, where the work is a musical composition:

        
 i. Performance Royalties Under Blanket Licenses. Licensor waives the
exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a performance
rights society (e.g. ASCAP, BMI, SESAC), royalties for the public
performance or public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the
Work.

          ii. Mechanical Rights and Statutory Royalties.
Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect, whether individually
or via a music rights agency or designated agent (e.g. Harry Fox

(""cover version"") and distribute, subject to the compulsory license
created by 17 USC Section 115 of the US Copyright Act (or the
equivalent in other jurisdictions).

     f. Webcasting Rights and
Statutory Royalties. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a
sound recording, Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect,
whether individually or via a performance-rights society (e.g.
SoundExchange), royalties for the public digital performance (e.g.
webcast) of the Work, subject to the compulsory license created by 17
USC Section 114 of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other
jurisdictions). 

The above rights may be exercised in all media and
formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above rights
include the right to make such modifications as are technically
necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats. All
rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.

4.
Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made
subject to and limited by the following restrictions:

     a. You may
distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally
perform the Work only under the terms of this License, and You must
include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this
License with every copy or phonorecord of the Work You distribute,
publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform. You
may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that alter or restrict
the terms of this License or the recipients' exercise of the rights
granted hereunder. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep
intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of
warranties. You may not distribute, publicly display, publicly
perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work with any technological
measures that control access or use of the Work in a manner
inconsistent with the terms of this License Agreement. The above
applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collective Work, but this
does not require the Collective Work apart from the Work itself to be
made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collective
Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent
practicable, remove from the Collective Work any reference to such
Licensor or the Original Author, as requested. If You create a
Derivative Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent
practicable, remove from the Derivative Work any reference to such
Licensor or the Original Author, as requested.

     b. If you
distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally
perform the Work or any Derivative Works or Collective Works, You must
keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and give the Original
Author credit reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing by
conveying the name (or pseudonym if applicable) of the Original Author
if supplied; the title of the Work if supplied; to the extent
reasonably practicable, the Uniform Resource Identifier, if any, that
Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI
does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for
the Work; and in the case of a Derivative Work, a credit identifying
the use of the Work in the Derivative Work (e.g., ""French translation
of the Work by Original Author,"" or ""Screenplay based on original Work
by Original Author""). Such credit may be implemented in any reasonable
manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Derivative Work or
Collective Work, at a minimum such credit will appear where any other
comparable authorship credit appears and in a manner at least as
prominent as such other comparable authorship credit.

5.

PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER
DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR
NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF
IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

6.
Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE
LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY
FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY
DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF
LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7.
Termination

will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of

Works or Collective Works from You under this License, however, will

entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2,
5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.

     b.
Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is
perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work).
Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the
Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at
any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to
withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is
required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this
License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as
stated above.

8. Miscellaneous

     a. Each time You distribute or
publicly digitally perform the Work or a Collective Work, the Licensor
offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and
conditions as the license granted to You under this License.

     b.
Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform a Derivative
Work, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work
on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under
this License.

     c. If any provision of this License is invalid or
unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity
or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and
without further action by the parties to this agreement, such
provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make
such provision valid and enforceable.

     d. No term or provision of
this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless

THE
WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE
COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE (""CCPL"" OR ""LICENSE""). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY

AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.

1. Definitions

     a. ""Collective Work"" means
a work, such as a periodical issue, anthology or encyclopedia, in
which the Work in its entirety in unmodified form, along with a number
of other contributions, constituting separate and independent works in

constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work
(as defined below) for the purposes of this License.

     b.
""Derivative Work"" means a work based upon the Work or upon the Work
and other pre-existing works, such as a translation, musical
arrangement, dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture version,
sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment, condensation, or any
other form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted,
except that a work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be
considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License. For the
avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical composition or sound
recording, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a
moving image (""synching"") will be considered a Derivative Work for the
purpose of this License.

     c. ""Licensor"" means the individual or
entity that offers the Work under the terms of this License.

     d.
""Original Author"" means the individual or entity who created the
Work.

     e. ""Work"" means the copyrightable work of authorship
offered under the terms of this License.

individual or entity exercising rights under this License who has not
previously violated the terms of this License with respect to the
Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to
exercise rights under this License despite a previous violation.

2.
Fair Use Rights. Nothing in this license is intended to reduce, limit,
or restrict any rights arising from fair use, first sale or other
limitations on the exclusive rights of the copyright owner under
copyright law or other applicable laws.

the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants You a
worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of

     a. to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the
Work into one or more Collective Works, and to reproduce the Work as
incorporated in the Collective Works;

     c. to distribute copies or phonorecords of,
display publicly, perform publicly, and perform publicly by means of a
digital audio transmission the Work including as incorporated in
Collective Works;

     d. to distribute copies or phonorecords of,
display publicly, perform publicly, and perform publicly by means of a
digital audio transmission Derivative Works.

     e. For the
avoidance of doubt, where the work is a musical composition:

        
 i. Performance Royalties Under Blanket Licenses. Licensor waives the
exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a performance
rights society (e.g. ASCAP, BMI, SESAC), royalties for the public
performance or public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the
Work.

          ii. Mechanical Rights and Statutory Royalties.
Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect, whether individually
or via a music rights agency or designated agent (e.g. Harry Fox
Agency), royalties for any phonorecord You create from the Work
(""cover version"") and distribute, subject to the compulsory license
created by 17 USC Section 115 of the US Copyright Act (or the
equivalent in other jurisdictions).

     f. Webcasting Rights and
Statutory Royalties. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a
sound recording, Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect,
whether individually or via a performance-rights society (e.g.
SoundExchange), royalties for the public digital performance (e.g.
webcast) of the Work, subject to the compulsory license created by 17
USC Section 114 of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other

include the right to make such modifications as are technically
necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats. All
rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.

4.
Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made
subject to and limited by the following restrictions:

     a. You may
distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally
perform the Work only under the terms of this License, and You must
include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this

Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent
practicable, remove from the Collective Work any credit as required by
clause 4(b), as requested. If You create a Derivative Work, upon

for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are
utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if
applicable) if supplied, and/or (ii) if the Original Author and/or
Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g. a sponsor institute,
publishing entity, journal) for attribution in Licensor's copyright
notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of
such party or parties; the title of the Work if supplied; to the
extent reasonably practicable, the Uniform Resource Identifier, if
any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless
such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing
information for the Work; and in the case of a Derivative Work, a
credit identifying the use of the Work in the Derivative Work (e.g.,
""French translation of the Work by Original Author,"" or ""Screenplay
based on original Work by Original Author""). Such credit may be
implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the
case of a Derivative Work or Collective Work, at a minimum such credit
will appear where any other comparable authorship credit appears and
in a manner at least as prominent as such other comparable authorship
credit.

cinematographic adaptations or any other form in which the Work may be

to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing
scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the exclusive right to
collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted

          iii. Voluntary License Schemes.
The Licensor waives the right to collect royalties, whether

the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every
copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer
or impose any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this
License or the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the
rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. You
may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that
refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every
copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You
Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any
effective technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability
of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to
that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a)
applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not
require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made subject
to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection, upon notice
from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the
Collection any credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested. If
You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to
the extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as
required by Section 4(b), as requested.

     b. If You Distribute, or
Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or Collections, You must,
unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact
all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the
medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author
(or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original
Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a
sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution
(""Attribution Parties"") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of
service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or
parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent
reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be
associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the
copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and (iv) ,
consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a credit
identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., ""French
translation of the Work by Original Author,"" or ""Screenplay based on
original Work by Original Author""). The credit required by this
Section 4 (b) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided,
however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum
such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of
the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these credits
and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other
contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the
credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the
manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this
License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any
connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author,
Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your
use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written
permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution
Parties.

     c. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the
Licensor or as may be otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You
Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or
as part of any Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort,
mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in relation to the
Work which would be prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or
reputation. Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan),
in which any exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this
License (the right to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a
distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory action
prejudicial to the Original Author's honor and reputation, the
Licensor will waive or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to
the fullest extent permitted by the applicable national law, to enable
You to reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this
License (right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise.

5.
Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer

UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY
AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS
AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE
WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER
DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR
NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF
IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

6.
Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE
LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY
FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY
DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF
LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7.
Termination

     a. This License and the rights granted hereunder
will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of
this License. Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or
Collections from You under this License, however, will not have their
licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in
full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8
will survive any termination of this License.

     b. Subject to the
above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for
the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding
the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under
different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time;
provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw
this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to
be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will
continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated
above.

8. Miscellaneous

     a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly
Perform the Work or a Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient
a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license
granted to You under this License.

     b. Each time You Distribute
or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor offers to the recipient a
license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the
license granted to You under this License.

     c. If any provision
of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it
shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of
the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties
to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum
extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.

    
d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no
breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing
and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.
This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with
respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings,
agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified
here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that
may appear in any communication from You.

     e. This License may
not be modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor
and You.

     f. The rights granted under, and the subject matter
referenced, in this License were drafted utilizing the terminology of
the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works
(as amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the
WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms
Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on
July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter take effect in the
relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be
enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the
implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable national
law. If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable
copyright law includes additional rights not granted under this
License, such additional rights are deemed to be included in the
License; this License is not intended to restrict the license of any
rights under applicable law.

Corporation (“Creative Commons”) is not a law firm and does not
provide legal services or legal advice. Distribution of Creative

relationship. Creative Commons makes its licenses and related

Using Creative Commons Public
Licenses

Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of
terms and conditions that creators and other rights holders may use to
share original works of authorship and other material subject to
copyright and certain other rights specified in the public license
below. The following considerations are for informational purposes
only, are not exhaustive, and do not form part of our
licenses.

Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are
intended for use by those authorized to give the public permission to
use material in ways otherwise restricted by copyright and certain
other rights. Our licenses are irrevocable. Licensors should read and
understand the terms and conditions of the license they choose before
applying it. Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before
applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the material as
expected. Licensors should clearly mark any material not subject to
the license. This includes other CC-licensed material, or material
used under an exception or limitation to copyright. More
considerations for licensors.

Considerations for the public: By using
one of our public licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to
use the licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If the
licensor’s permission is not necessary for any reason–for example,
because of any applicable exception or limitation to copyright–then
that use is not regulated by the license. Our licenses grant only
permissions under copyright and certain other rights that a licensor
has authority to grant. Use of the licensed material may still be
restricted for other reasons, including because others have copyright
or other rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests,
such as asking that all changes be marked or described. Although not
required by our licenses, you are encouraged to respect those requests
where reasonable. More considerations for the public. 

Creative
Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License

By exercising
the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree to be bound
by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons Attribution 4.0
International Public License (""Public License""). To the extent this
Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are granted the
Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of these terms and
conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in consideration
of benefits the Licensor receives from making the Licensed Material
available under these terms and conditions.

Section 1 –
Definitions.
     
     a.	Adapted Material means material subject to
Copyright and Similar Rights that is derived from or based upon the
Licensed Material and in which the Licensed Material is translated,
altered, arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner
requiring permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by
the Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed
Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording, Adapted
Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is synched in
timed relation with a moving image.
	
     b.	Adapter's License means
the license You apply to Your Copyright and Similar Rights in Your
contributions to Adapted Material in accordance with the terms and
conditions of this Public License.
	
     c.	Copyright and Similar
Rights means copyright and/or similar rights closely related to
copyright including, without limitation, performance, broadcast, sound
recording, and Sui Generis Database Rights, without regard to how the
rights are labeled or categorized. For purposes of this Public
License, the rights specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright
and Similar Rights.
	
     d.	Effective Technological Measures means
those measures that, in the absence of proper authority, may not be
circumvented under laws fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the
WIPO Copyright Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar
international agreements.
	
     e.	Exceptions and Limitations means
fair use, fair dealing, and/or any other exception or limitation to
Copyright and Similar Rights that applies to Your use of the Licensed
Material.
	
     f.	Licensed Material means the artistic or literary
work, database, or other material to which the Licensor applied this
Public License.
	
     g.	Licensed Rights means the rights granted to
You subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, which
are limited to all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use
of the Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to
license.
	
     h.	Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies)
granting rights under this Public License.
	
     i.	Share means to
provide material to the public by any means or process that requires
permission under the Licensed Rights, such as reproduction, public
display, public performance, distribution, dissemination,
communication, or importation, and to make material available to the
public including in ways that members of the public may access the
material from a place and at a time individually chosen by them.
	
   
 j.	Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright
resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the
Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, as
amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially equivalent
rights anywhere in the world.
	
     k.	You means the individual or
entity exercising the Licensed Rights under this Public License. Your
has a corresponding meaning.

Section 2 – Scope.
	
     a.	License
grant.
	
          1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Public License, the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide,
royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to
exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:

           
   A. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part;
and     

               B. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted
Material.

          2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance
of doubt, where Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this
Public License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with its
terms and conditions.
	
          3. Term. The term of this Public
License is specified in Section 6(a).
	
          4. Media and
formats; technical modifications allowed. The Licensor authorizes You
to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats whether now
known or hereafter created, and to make technical modifications
necessary to do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert
any right or authority to forbid You from making technical
modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including
technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective
Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License, simply
making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)(4) never produces
Adapted Material.
	
          5. Downstream recipients.

             
 A. Offer from the Licensor – Licensed Material. Every recipient of
the Licensed Material automatically receives an offer from the
Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights under the terms and
conditions of this Public License.

               B. No downstream
restrictions. You may not offer or impose any additional or different
terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures
to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the
Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed Material.
	
         
6.  No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may
be construed as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that
Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected with, or sponsored,
endorsed, or granted official status by, the Licensor or others
designated to receive attribution as provided in Section
3(a)(1)(A)(i).
	
b. Other rights.

          1. Moral rights, such as
the right of integrity, are not licensed under this Public License,
nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar personality rights;
however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not
to assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited extent
necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights, but not
otherwise.
	
          2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed
under this Public License.
	
          3. To the extent possible, the
Licensor waives any right to collect royalties from You for the
exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether directly or through a
collecting society under any voluntary or waivable statutory or
compulsory licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly
reserves any right to collect such royalties.   

Section 3 –
License Conditions.

Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly
made subject to the following conditions.
	
     a.	Attribution.
	
   
      1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified
form), You must:

               A. retain the following if it is
supplied by the Licensor with the Licensed Material:

                
   i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed Material and
any others designated to receive attribution, in any reasonable manner
requested by the Licensor (including by pseudonym if designated);

   
                ii. a copyright notice;

                    iii. a
notice that refers to this Public License;

                    iv.	a
notice that refers to the disclaimer of warranties;

                 
  v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the extent
reasonably practicable;

               B. indicate if You modified
the Licensed Material and retain an indication of any previous
modifications; and
	
               C. indicate the Licensed Material
is licensed under this Public License, and include the text of, or the
URI or hyperlink to, this Public License.
	
          2. You may
satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any reasonable manner
based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share the
Licensed Material. For example, it may be reasonable to satisfy the
conditions by providing a URI or hyperlink to a resource that includes
the required information.
	
          3. If requested by the Licensor,
You must remove any of the information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A)
to the extent reasonably practicable.
	
          4. If You Share
Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's License You apply must not
prevent recipients of the Adapted Material from complying with this
Public License.

Section 4 – Sui Generis Database Rights.

Where the
Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your
use of the Licensed Material:
	
     a.	for the avoidance of doubt,
Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to extract, reuse, reproduce, and
Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database;
	

    b.	if You include all or a substantial portion of the database
contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights,
then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but
not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and
	
     c.	You
must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all or a
substantial portion of the contents of the database.
For the avoidance
of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace Your
obligations under this Public License where the Licensed Rights
include other Copyright and Similar Rights.

Section 5 – Disclaimer
of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.
	
     a.	Unless otherwise
separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent possible, the
Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available, and
makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the
Licensed Material, whether express, implied, statutory, or other. This
includes, without limitation, warranties of title, merchantability,
fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent
or other defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence of errors,
whether or not known or discoverable. Where disclaimers of warranties
are not allowed in full or in part, this disclaimer may not apply to
You.
	
     b.	To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor
be liable to You on any legal theory (including, without limitation,
negligence) or otherwise for any direct, special, indirect,
incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary, or other losses,
costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this Public License or use
of the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor has been advised of the
possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where a
limitation of liability is not allowed in full or in part, this
limitation may not apply to You.
	
     c.	The disclaimer of
warranties and limitation of liability provided above shall be
interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely
approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all
liability.

Section 6 – Term and Termination.
	
     a.	This Public
License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights
licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public
License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate
automatically.
	
     b.	Where Your right to use the Licensed Material
has terminated under Section 6(a), it reinstates:
	
          1.
automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is
cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or
	
        
 2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.
	
     c.	For the
avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the
Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public
License.
	
     d.	For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also
offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop
distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will
not terminate this Public License.
	
     e.	Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and
8 survive termination of this Public License.

Section 7 – Other
Terms and Conditions.
	
     a.	The Licensor shall not be bound by any
additional or different terms or conditions communicated by You unless
expressly agreed.
	
     b.	Any arrangements, understandings, or
agreements regarding the Licensed Material not stated herein are
separate from and independent of the terms and conditions of this
Public License.

Section 8 – Interpretation.
	
     a.	For the
avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not be
interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any
use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without
permission under this Public License.
	
     b.	To the extent
possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed
unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum
extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be
reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License without
affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions.
	

    c.	No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and
no failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the
Licensor.
	
     d.	Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may
be interpreted as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and
immunities that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal
processes of any jurisdiction or authority.

 CREATIVE COMMONS
CORPORATION IS NOT A LAW FIRM AND DOES NOT PROVIDE LEGAL SERVICES.
DISTRIBUTION OF THIS DRAFT LICENSE DOES NOT CREATE AN ATTORNEY-CLIENT
RELATIONSHIP. CREATIVE COMMONS PROVIDES THIS INFORMATION ON AN ""AS-IS""
BASIS. CREATIVE COMMONS MAKES NO WARRANTIES REGARDING THE INFORMATION
PROVIDED, AND DISCLAIMS LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM ITS USE.


License

THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF
THIS CREATIVE COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE (""CCPL"" OR ""LICENSE""). THE WORK
IS PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE
WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE IS PROHIBITED.

BY
EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE
TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE
RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH
TERMS AND CONDITIONS.

1. Definitions

     a. ""Collective Work"" means
a work, such as a periodical issue, anthology or encyclopedia, in
which the Work in its entirety in unmodified form, along with a number
of other contributions, constituting separate and independent works in
themselves, are assembled into a collective whole. A work that
constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work
(as defined below) for the purposes of this License.

      b.
""Derivative Work"" means a work based upon the Work or upon the Work
and other pre-existing works, such as a translation, musical
arrangement, dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture version,
sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment, condensation, or any
other form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted,
except that a work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be
considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License.

     c.
""Licensor"" means the individual or entity that offers the Work under
the terms of this License.

     d. ""Original Author"" means the
individual or entity who created the Work.

     e. ""Work"" means the
copyrightable work of authorship offered under the terms of this
License.

     f. ""You"" means an individual or entity exercising
rights under this License who has not previously violated the terms of
this License with respect to the Work, or who has received express
permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License
despite a previous violation.

2. Fair Use Rights. Nothing in this
license is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any rights arising
from fair use, first sale or other limitations on the exclusive rights
of the copyright owner under copyright law or other applicable
laws.

3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
License, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable
copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work as stated
below:

     a. to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into
one or more Collective Works, and to reproduce the Work as
incorporated in the Collective Works;

     b. to create and reproduce
Derivative Works;

     c. to distribute copies or phonorecords of,
display publicly, perform publicly, and perform publicly by means of a
digital audio transmission the Work including as incorporated in
Collective Works;

     d. to distribute copies or phonorecords of,
display publicly, perform publicly, and perform publicly by means of a
digital audio transmission Derivative Works;

The above rights may be
exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter
devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications
as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and
formats. All rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby
reserved.

4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is
expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:


    a. You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or
publicly digitally perform the Work only under the terms of this
License, and You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource
Identifier for, this License with every copy or phonorecord of the
Work You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly
digitally perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work
that alter or restrict the terms of this License or the recipients'
exercise of the rights granted hereunder. You may not sublicense the
Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and
to the disclaimer of warranties. You may not distribute, publicly
display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work with
any technological measures that control access or use of the Work in a
manner inconsistent with the terms of this License Agreement. The
above applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collective Work, but
this does not require the Collective Work apart from the Work itself
to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a
Collective Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent
practicable, remove from the Collective Work any reference to such
Licensor or the Original Author, as requested. If You create a
Derivative Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent
practicable, remove from the Derivative Work any reference to such
Licensor or the Original Author, as requested.

     b. You may not
exercise any of the rights granted to You in Section 3 above in any
manner that is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial
advantage or private monetary compensation. The exchange of the Work
for other copyrighted works by means of digital file-sharing or
otherwise shall not be considered to be intended for or directed
toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation, provided
there is no payment of any monetary compensation in connection with
the exchange of copyrighted works.

     c. If you distribute,
publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the
Work or any Derivative Works or Collective Works, You must keep intact
all copyright notices for the Work and give the Original Author credit
reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing by conveying the
name (or pseudonym if applicable) of the Original Author if supplied;
the title of the Work if supplied; in the case of a Derivative Work, a
credit identifying the use of the Work in the Derivative Work (e.g.,
""French translation of the Work by Original Author,"" or ""Screenplay
based on original Work by Original Author""). Such credit may be
implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the
case of a Derivative Work or Collective Work, at a minimum such credit
will appear where any other comparable authorship credit appears and
in a manner at least as prominent as such other comparable authorship
credit.

5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer

By offering
the Work for public release under this License, Licensor represents
and warrants that, to the best of Licensor's knowledge after
reasonable inquiry: Licensor has secured all rights in the Work

License

THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF
THIS CREATIVE COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE (""CCPL"" OR ""LICENSE""). THE WORK
IS PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE
WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS
PROHIBITED.

BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU
ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. THE
LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR
ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.

1. Definitions

     a.
""Collective Work"" means a work, such as a periodical issue, anthology
or encyclopedia, in which the Work in its entirety in unmodified form,
along with a number of other contributions, constituting separate and
independent works in themselves, are assembled into a collective
whole. A work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be
considered a Derivative Work (as defined below) for the purposes of
this License.

     b. ""Derivative Work"" means a work based upon the
Work or upon the Work and other pre-existing works, such as a
translation, musical arrangement, dramatization, fictionalization,
motion picture version, sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment,
condensation, or any other form in which the Work may be recast,
transformed, or adapted, except that a work that constitutes a
Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work for the
purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is
a musical composition or sound recording, the synchronization of the
Work in timed-relation with a moving image (""synching"") will be
considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License.

     c.
""Licensor"" means the individual or entity that offers the Work under
the terms of this License.

     d. ""Original Author"" means the
individual or entity who created the Work.

     e. ""Work"" means the
copyrightable work of authorship offered under the terms of this
License.

     f. ""You"" means an individual or entity exercising
rights under this License who has not previously violated the terms of
this License with respect to the Work, or who has received express
permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License
despite a previous violation.

2. Fair Use Rights. Nothing in this
license is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any rights arising
from fair use, first sale or other limitations on the exclusive rights
of the copyright owner under copyright law or other applicable
laws.

3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
License, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable
copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work as stated
below:

     a. to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into
one or more Collective Works, and to reproduce the Work as
incorporated in the Collective Works;

     b. to create and reproduce
Derivative Works;

     c. to distribute copies or phonorecords of,
display publicly, perform publicly, and perform publicly by means of a
digital audio transmission the Work including as incorporated in
Collective Works;

     d. to distribute copies or phonorecords of,
display publicly, perform publicly, and perform publicly by means of a
digital audio transmission Derivative Works;

The above rights may be
exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter
devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications
as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and
formats. All rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby
reserved, including but not limited to the rights set forth in
Sections 4(d) and 4(e).

4. Restrictions.The license granted in
Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the
following restrictions:

     a. You may distribute, publicly display,
publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work only under
the terms of this License, and You must include a copy of, or the
Uniform Resource Identifier for, this License with every copy or
phonorecord of the Work You distribute, publicly display, publicly
perform, or publicly digitally perform. You may not offer or impose
any terms on the Work that alter or restrict the terms of this License
or the recipients' exercise of the rights granted hereunder. You may
not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer
to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties. You may not
distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally
perform the Work with any technological measures that control access
or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with the terms of this
License Agreement. The above applies to the Work as incorporated in a
Collective Work, but this does not require the Collective Work apart
from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License.
If You create a Collective Work, upon notice from any Licensor You
must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collective Work any
reference to such Licensor or the Original Author, as requested. If
You create a Derivative Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must,
to the extent practicable, remove from the Derivative Work any
reference to such Licensor or the Original Author, as requested.

    
b. You may not exercise any of the rights granted to You in Section 3
above in any manner that is primarily intended for or directed toward
commercial advantage or private monetary compensation. The exchange of
the Work for other copyrighted works by means of digital file-sharing
or otherwise shall not be considered to be intended for or directed
toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation, provided
there is no payment of any monetary compensation in connection with
the exchange of copyrighted works.

     c. If you distribute,
publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the
Work or any Derivative Works or Collective Works, You must keep intact
all copyright notices for the Work and give the Original Author credit
reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing by conveying the
name (or pseudonym if applicable) of the Original Author if supplied;
the title of the Work if supplied; to the extent reasonably
practicable, the Uniform Resource Identifier, if any, that Licensor
specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not
refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work;
and in the case of a Derivative Work, a credit identifying the use of
the Work in the Derivative Work (e.g., ""French translation of the Work
by Original Author,"" or ""Screenplay based on original Work by Original
Author""). Such credit may be implemented in any reasonable manner;
provided, however, that in the case of a Derivative Work or Collective
Work, at a minimum such credit will appear where any other comparable
authorship credit appears and in a manner at least as prominent as
such other comparable authorship credit.

     d. For the avoidance of
doubt, where the Work is a musical composition: 

          i.
Performance Royalties Under Blanket Licenses. Licensor reserves the
exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a performance
rights society (e.g. ASCAP, BMI, SESAC), royalties for the public
performance or public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work
if that performance is primarily intended for or directed toward
commercial advantage or private monetary compensation.

          ii.
Mechanical Rights and Statutory Royalties. Licensor reserves the
exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a music rights
agency or designated agent (e.g. Harry Fox Agency), royalties for any
phonorecord You create from the Work (""cover version"") and distribute,
subject to the compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 115 of the
US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions), if Your
distribution of such cover version is primarily intended for or
directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation.
Webcasting Rights and Statutory Royalties. For the avoidance of doubt,
where the Work is a sound recording, Licensor reserves the exclusive
right to collect, whether individually or via a performance-rights
society (e.g. SoundExchange), royalties for the public digital
performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work, subject to the compulsory
license created by 17 USC Section 114 of the US Copyright Act (or the
equivalent in other jurisdictions), if Your public digital performance
is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or
private monetary compensation.

5. Representations, Warranties and
Disclaimer

UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN
WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS
OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED,
STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF
TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE,
NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY,
OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE.
SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES,
SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

6. Limitation on Liability.
EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL
LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL,
INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT
OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN
ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. Termination

     a.
This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License.
Individuals or entities who have received Derivative Works or
Collective Works from You under this License, however, will not have
their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain
in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8
will survive any termination of this License.

     b. Subject to the
above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for
the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding
the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under
different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time;
provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw
this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to
be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will
continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated
above.

8. Miscellaneous

     a. Each time You distribute or publicly
digitally perform the Work or a Collective Work, the Licensor offers
to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and
conditions as the license granted to You under this License.

     b.
Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform a Derivative
Work, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work
on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under
this License.

     c. If any provision of this License is invalid or
unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity
or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and
without further action by the parties to this agreement, such
provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make
such provision valid and enforceable.

     d. No term or provision of
this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless
such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to
be charged with such waiver or consent.

     e. This License
constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to
the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or
representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor
shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any
communication from You. This License may not be modified without the

upon the Work and other pre-existing works, such as a translation,
adaptation, derivative work, arrangement of music or other alterations
of a literary or artistic work, or phonogram or performance and
includes cinematographic adaptations or any other form in which the
Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted including in any form
recognizably derived from the original, except that a work that
constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation for the
purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is
a musical work, performance or phonogram, the synchronization of the
Work in timed-relation with a moving image (""synching"") will be
considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this License.

""Collection"" means a collection of literary or artistic works, such as
encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances, phonograms or
broadcasts, or other works or subject matter other than works listed
in Section 1(f) below, which, by reason of the selection and
arrangement of their contents, constitute intellectual creations, in
which the Work is included in its entirety in unmodified form along
with one or more other contributions, each constituting separate and
independent works in themselves, which together are assembled into a
collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collection will not be
considered an Adaptation (as defined above) for the purposes of this
License.

the original and copies of the Work or Adaptation, as appropriate,
through sale or other transfer of ownership.

performance the actors, singers, musicians, dancers, and other persons
who act, sing, deliver, declaim, play in, interpret or otherwise
perform literary or artistic works or expressions of folklore; (ii) in
the case of a phonogram the producer being the person or legal entity

three-dimensional work relative to geography, topography, architecture
or science; a performance; a broadcast; a phonogram; a compilation of
data to the extent it is protected as a copyrightable work; or a work
performed by a variety or circus performer to the extent it is not
otherwise considered a literary or artistic work.

     g. ""You"" means
an individual or entity exercising rights under this License who has
not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to the
Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to
exercise rights under this License despite a previous violation.

    
h. ""Publicly Perform"" means to perform public recitations of the Work
and to communicate to the public those public recitations, by any
means or process, including by wire or wireless means or public
digital performances; to make available to the public Works in such a
way that members of the public may access these Works from a place and
at a place individually chosen by them; to perform the Work to the
public by any means or process and the communication to the public of
the performances of the Work, including by public digital performance;
to broadcast and rebroadcast the Work by any means including signs,
sounds or images.

     i. ""Reproduce"" means to make copies of the
Work by any means including without limitation by sound or visual
recordings and the right of fixation and reproducing fixations of the
Work, including storage of a protected performance or phonogram in
digital form or other electronic medium.

2. Fair Dealing Rights.
Nothing in this License is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any
uses free from copyright or rights arising from limitations or
exceptions that are provided for in connection with the copyright
protection under copyright law or other applicable laws.

3. License
Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor
hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual
(for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the
rights in the Work as stated below:

     a. to Reproduce the Work, to
incorporate the Work into one or more Collections, and to Reproduce
the Work as incorporated in the Collections;

     b. to create and
Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such Adaptation, including any
translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps to clearly label,
demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made to the original
Work. For example, a translation could be marked ""The original work
was translated from English to Spanish,"" or a modification could
indicate ""The original work has been modified."";

     c. to
Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated in
Collections; and,

     d. to Distribute and Publicly Perform
Adaptations.

The above rights may be exercised in all media and
formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above rights
include the right to make such modifications as are technically
necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats. Subject
to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly granted by Licensor are
hereby reserved, including but not limited to the rights set forth in
Section 4(d).

4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above
is expressly made subject to and limited by the following
restrictions:

     a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work
only under the terms of this License. You must include a copy of, or
the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every
copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer
or impose any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this
License or the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the
rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. You
may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that
refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every
copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You
Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any
effective technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability
of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to
that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a)
applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not
require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made subject
to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection, upon notice
from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the
Collection any credit as required by Section 4(c), as requested. If
You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to
the extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as
required by Section 4(c), as requested.

     b. You may not exercise
any of the rights granted to You in Section 3 above in any manner that
is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or
private monetary compensation. The exchange of the Work for other
copyrighted works by means of digital file-sharing or otherwise shall
not be considered to be intended for or directed toward commercial
advantage or private monetary compensation, provided there is no
payment of any monetary compensation in connection with the exchange
of copyrighted works.

     c. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform
the Work or any Adaptations or Collections, You must, unless a request
has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright
notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means
You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym,
if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or
Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor
institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution (""Attribution
Parties"") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other
reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of
the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the
URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work,
unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing
information for the Work; and, (iv) consistent with Section 3(b), in
the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in
the Adaptation (e.g., ""French translation of the Work by Original
Author,"" or ""Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author"").
The credit required by this Section 4(c) may be implemented in any
reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation
or Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for
all contributing authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then
as part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the
credits for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of
doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section for the
purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising
Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly
assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the
Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate,
of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express prior
written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution
Parties.

     d. For the avoidance of doubt:

          i.
Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in
which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or
compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves
the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You
of the rights granted under this License;

          ii. Waivable
Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right
to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing
scheme can be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to
collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted
under this License if Your exercise of such rights is for a purpose or
use which is otherwise than noncommercial as permitted under Section
4(b) and otherwise waives the right to collect royalties through any
statutory or compulsory licensing scheme; and,

          iii.
Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor reserves the right to collect
royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is
a member of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing
schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the rights
granted under this License that is for a purpose or use which is
otherwise than noncommercial as permitted under Section 4(c).

     e.
Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be
otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or
Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any
Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or
take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be
prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or reputation. Licensor
agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise
of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to
make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation,
modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original
Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert,
as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the
applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your
right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations)
but not otherwise.

5. Representations, Warranties and
Disclaimer

UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN
WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS
OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED,
STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF
TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE,
NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY,
OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE.
SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES,
SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

6. Limitation on Liability.
EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL
LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL,
INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT
OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN
ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. Termination

     a.
This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License.
Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections
from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses
terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full
compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will
survive any termination of this License.

     b. Subject to the above
terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the
duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the
above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different
license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided,
however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License
(or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted
under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in
full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.

8.
Miscellaneous

     a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform
the Work or a Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a
license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license
granted to You under this License.

     b. Each time You Distribute
or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor offers to the recipient a
license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the
license granted to You under this License.

     c. If any provision
of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it
shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of
the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties
to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum
extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.

    
d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no
breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing
and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.

  
  e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties
with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings,
agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified
here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that
may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be
modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and
You.

     f. The rights granted under, and the subject matter
referenced, in this License were drafted utilizing the terminology of
the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works
(as amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the
WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms
Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on
July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter take effect in the
relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be
enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the
implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable national
law. If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable
copyright law includes additional rights not granted under this
License, such additional rights are deemed to be included in the
License; this License is not intended to restrict the license of any
rights under applicable law.

Using Creative Commons Public
Licenses
 
Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of
terms and conditions that creators and other rights holders may use to
share original works of authorship and other material subject to
copyright and certain other rights specified in the public license
below. The following considerations are for informational purposes
only, are not exhaustive, and do not form part of our
licenses.

Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are
intended for use by those authorized to give the public permission to
use material in ways otherwise restricted by copyright and certain
other rights. Our licenses are irrevocable. Licensors should read and
understand the terms and conditions of the license they choose before
applying it. Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before
applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the material as
expected. Licensors should clearly mark any material not subject to
the license. This includes other CC-licensed material, or material
used under an exception or limitation to copyright. More
considerations for licensors.

Considerations for the public: By using
one of our public licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to
use the licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If the
licensor’s permission is not necessary for any reason–for example,
because of any applicable exception or limitation to copyright–then
that use is not regulated by the license. Our licenses grant only
permissions under copyright and certain other rights that a licensor
has authority to grant. Use of the licensed material may still be
restricted for other reasons, including because others have copyright
or other rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests,
such as asking that all changes be marked or described. Although not
required by our licenses, you are encouraged to respect those requests
where reasonable. More considerations for the public. 

Creative

By
exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree
to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons
Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International Public License (""Public
License""). To the extent this Public License may be interpreted as a
contract, You are granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your
acceptance of these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You
such rights in consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from
making the Licensed Material available under these terms and
conditions.

Section 1 – Definitions.

     a.	Adapted Material
means material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights that is derived
from or based upon the Licensed Material and in which the Licensed
Material is translated, altered, arranged, transformed, or otherwise
modified in a manner requiring permission under the Copyright and
Similar Rights held by the Licensor. For purposes of this Public
License, where the Licensed Material is a musical work, performance,
or sound recording, Adapted Material is always produced where the
Licensed Material is synched in timed relation with a moving image.

closely related to copyright including, without limitation,
performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database
Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or categorized.

     d.	Effective
Technological Measures means those measures that, in the absence of
proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws fulfilling
obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright Treaty adopted on
December 20, 1996, and/or similar international agreements.
	
    
e.	Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or any
other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights that
applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.
	
     f.	Licensed
Material means the artistic or literary work, database, or other
material to which the Licensor applied this Public License.
	
    
g.	Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the

Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed
Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.
	
    
h.	Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights
under this Public License.
	
     i.	NonCommercial means not primarily
intended for or directed towards commercial advantage or monetary

Rights by digital file-sharing or similar means is NonCommercial
provided there is no payment of monetary compensation in connection
with the exchange.
	
     j.	Share means to provide material to the
public by any means or process that requires permission under the
Licensed Rights, such as reproduction, public display, public
performance, distribution, dissemination, communication, or

ways that members of the public may access the material from a place
and at a time individually chosen by them.
	
     k.	Sui Generis
Database Rights means rights other than copyright resulting from
Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11
March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, as amended and/or
succeeded, as well as other essentially equivalent rights anywhere in
the world.
	
     l.	You means the individual or entity exercising the
Licensed Rights under this Public License. Your has a corresponding
meaning.

Section 2 – Scope.
	
     a.	License grant.
	
          1.
Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the
Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to exercise the
Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:

               A.
reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part, for
NonCommercial purposes only; and

               B. produce,
reproduce, and Share Adapted Material for NonCommercial purposes
only.
	
          2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of
doubt, where Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public

and conditions.
	
          3. Term. The term of this Public License
is specified in Section 6(a).
	
          4. Media and formats;
technical modifications allowed. The Licensor authorizes You to
exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats whether now
known or hereafter created, and to make technical modifications
necessary to do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert
any right or authority to forbid You from making technical
modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including
technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective
Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License, simply
making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)(4) never produces
Adapted Material.
	
          5. Downstream recipients.

             
 A. Offer from the Licensor – Licensed Material. Every recipient of
the Licensed Material automatically receives an offer from the
Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights under the terms and
conditions of this Public License.
	
               B. No downstream
restrictions. You may not offer or impose any additional or different
terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures
to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the
Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed Material.
	
         
6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may
be construed as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that
Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected with, or sponsored,
endorsed, or granted official status by, the Licensor or others
designated to receive attribution as provided in Section
3(a)(1)(A)(i).
	
     b.	Other rights.
	
          1. Moral rights,
such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this Public
License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar personality
rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or
agrees not to assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the
limited extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights,
but not otherwise.

          2. Patent and trademark rights are not
licensed under this Public License.
	
          3. To the extent
possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect royalties from You
for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether directly or through a
collecting society under any voluntary or waivable statutory or
compulsory licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly
reserves any right to collect such royalties, including when the
Licensed Material is used other than for NonCommercial
purposes.

Section 3 – License Conditions.

Your exercise of the
Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the following
conditions.
	
     a.	Attribution.
	
          1. If You Share the
Licensed Material (including in modified form), You must:

           
   A. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor with the
Licensed Material:

                    i.	identification of the
creator(s) of the Licensed Material and any others designated to
receive attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by the
Licensor (including by pseudonym if designated);

                   
ii.	a copyright notice;

                    iii. a notice that refers
to this Public License;

                    iv.	a notice that refers
to the disclaimer of warranties;

                    v.	a URI or
hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the extent reasonably
practicable;
	
               B. indicate if You modified the Licensed
Material and retain an indication of any previous modifications; and


              C. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this
Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to,
this Public License.
	
          2. You may satisfy the conditions in
Section 3(a)(1) in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means,
and context in which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it
may be reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or
hyperlink to a resource that includes the required information.
	
    
     3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the
information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent reasonably
practicable.
	
          4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce,
the Adapter's License You apply must not prevent recipients of the
Adapted Material from complying with this Public License.

Section 4
– Sui Generis Database Rights.

Where the Licensed Rights include
Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed
Material:
	
     a.	for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants
You the right to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a
substantial portion of the contents of the database for NonCommercial
purposes only;
	
     b.	if You include all or a substantial portion
of the database contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis
Database Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis
Database Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material;
and
	
     c.	You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if
You Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the
database.
For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and
does not replace Your obligations under this Public License where the
Licensed Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.

Section 5
– Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.
	
    
a.	Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the
extent possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and
as-available, and makes no representations or warranties of any kind
concerning the Licensed Material, whether express, implied, statutory,
or other. This includes, without limitation, warranties of title,
merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement,
absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the presence or
absence of errors, whether or not known or discoverable. Where
disclaimers of warranties are not allowed in full or in part, this
disclaimer may not apply to You.
	
     b.	To the extent possible, in
no event will the Licensor be liable to You on any legal theory
(including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise for any
direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive,
exemplary, or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of
this Public License or use of the Licensed Material, even if the
Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such losses, costs,
expenses, or damages. Where a limitation of liability is not allowed
in full or in part, this limitation may not apply to You.
	
    
c.	The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided
above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible,
most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all
liability.

Section 6 – Term and Termination.
	
     a.	This Public
License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights
licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public
License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate
automatically.
	
     b.	Where Your right to use the Licensed Material
has terminated under Section 6(a), it reinstates:
	
          1.
automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is
cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or
	
        
 2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.
	
     c.	For the
avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the
Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public
License.
	
     d.	For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also
offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop
distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will

Public License.

interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any
use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without
permission under this Public License.
	
     b.	To the extent
possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed
unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum
extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be
reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License without
affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions.
	

    c.	No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and
no failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the
Licensor.
	
     d.	Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may
be interpreted as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and
immunities that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal
processes of any jurisdiction or authority.

THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW)
IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE
(""CCPL"" OR ""LICENSE""). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER
APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER
THIS LICENSE IS PROHIBITED.

BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK
PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS
LICENSE. THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN
CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.

1.
Definitions

     a. ""Collective Work"" means a work, such as a
periodical issue, anthology or encyclopedia, in which the Work in its
entirety in unmodified form, along with a number of other
contributions, constituting separate and independent works in
themselves, are assembled into a collective whole. A work that
constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work
(as defined below) for the purposes of this License.

     b.
""Derivative Work"" means a work based upon the Work or upon the Work
and other pre-existing works, such as a translation, musical
arrangement, dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture version,
sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment, condensation, or any
other form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted,
except that a work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be
considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License.

     c.
""Licensor"" means the individual or entity that offers the Work under
the terms of this License.

     d. ""Original Author"" means the
individual or entity who created the Work.

     e. ""Work"" means the
copyrightable work of authorship offered under the terms of this
License.

     f. ""You"" means an individual or entity exercising
rights under this License who has not previously violated the terms of
this License with respect to the Work, or who has received express
permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License
despite a previous violation.

2. Fair Use Rights. Nothing in this
license is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any rights arising
from fair use, first sale or other limitations on the exclusive rights
of the copyright owner under copyright law or other applicable
laws.

3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
License, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable
copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work as stated
below:

     a. to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into
one or more Collective Works, and to reproduce the Work as
incorporated in the Collective Works;

     b. to distribute copies or
phonorecords of, display publicly, perform publicly, and perform
publicly by means of a digital audio transmission the Work including
as incorporated in Collective Works;

The above rights may be
exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter
devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications
as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and
formats. All rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby
reserved.

4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is
expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:


    a. You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or
publicly digitally perform the Work only under the terms of this
License, and You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource
Identifier for, this License with every copy or phonorecord of the
Work You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly
digitally perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work
that alter or restrict the terms of this License or the recipients'
exercise of the rights granted hereunder. You may not sublicense the
Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and
to the disclaimer of warranties. You may not distribute, publicly
display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work with
any technological measures that control access or use of the Work in a
manner inconsistent with the terms of this License Agreement. The
above applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collective Work, but
this does not require the Collective Work apart from the Work itself
to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a
Collective Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent
practicable, remove from the Collective Work any reference to such
Licensor or the Original Author, as requested.

     b. You may not
exercise any of the rights granted to You in Section 3 above in any
manner that is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial
advantage or private monetary compensation. The exchange of the Work
for other copyrighted works by means of digital file-sharing or
otherwise shall not be considered to be intended for or directed
toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation, provided
there is no payment of any monetary compensation in connection with
the exchange of copyrighted works.

     c. If you distribute,
publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the
Work or any Collective Works, You must keep intact all copyright
notices for the Work and give the Original Author credit reasonable to
the medium or means You are utilizing by conveying the name (or
pseudonym if applicable) of the Original Author if supplied; the title
of the Work if supplied. Such credit may be implemented in any
reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Collective
Work, at a minimum such credit will appear where any other comparable
authorship credit appears and in a manner at least as prominent as
such other comparable authorship credit.

5. Representations,
Warranties and Disclaimer

     a. By offering the Work for public
release under this License, Licensor represents and warrants that, to
the best of Licensor's knowledge after reasonable inquiry:

         
i. Licensor has secured all rights in the Work necessary to grant the
license rights hereunder and to permit the lawful exercise of the
rights granted hereunder without You having any obligation to pay any
royalties, compulsory license fees, residuals or any other payments;


         ii. The Work does not infringe the copyright, trademark,
publicity rights, common law rights or any other right of any third
party or constitute defamation, invasion of privacy or other tortious
injury to any third party.

     b. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY STATED IN THIS
LICENSE OR OTHERWISE AGREED IN WRITING OR REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW,
THE WORK IS LICENSED ON AN ""AS IS"" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY
KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY
WARRANTIES REGARDING THE CONTENTS OR ACCURACY OF THE WORK.

6.
Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE
LAW, AND EXCEPT FOR DAMAGES ARISING FROM LIABILITY TO A THIRD PARTY
RESULTING FROM BREACH OF THE WARRANTIES IN SECTION 5, IN NO EVENT WILL
LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL,
INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT
OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN
ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. Termination

     a.
This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License.
Individuals or entities who have received Collective Works from You
under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated
provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with
those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any
termination of this License.

     b. Subject to the above terms and
conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of
the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above,
Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different
license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided,
however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License
(or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted
under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in
full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.

8.
Miscellaneous

     a. Each time You distribute or publicly digitally
perform the Work or a Collective Work, the Licensor offers to the
recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as
the license granted to You under this License.

     b. If any
provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable
law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the
remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by
the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the
minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and
enforceable.

     c. No term or provision of this License shall be
deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent
shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such
waiver or consent.

     d. This License constitutes the entire
agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here.
There are no understandings, agreements or representations with
respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by
any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from
You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written
agreement of the Licensor and You. 

Creative Commons is not a party
to this License, and makes no warranty whatsoever in connection with
the Work. Creative Commons will not be liable to You or any party on
any legal theory for any damages whatsoever, including without
limitation any general, special, incidental or consequential damages
arising in connection to this license. Notwithstanding the foregoing
two (2) sentences, if Creative Commons has expressly identified itself
as the Licensor hereunder, it shall have all rights and obligations of
Licensor.

Except for the limited purpose of indicating to the public
that the Work is licensed under the CCPL, neither party will use the
trademark ""Creative Commons"" or any related trademark or logo of
Creative Commons without the prior written consent of Creative
Commons. Any permitted use will be in compliance with Creative

avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical composition or sound

moving image (""synching"") will be considered a Derivative Work for the
purpose of this License.

exercise any of the rights granted to You in Section 3 above in any
manner that is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial
advantage or private monetary compensation. The exchange of the Work
for other copyrighted works by means of digital file-sharing or
otherwise shall not be considered to be intended for or directed
toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation, provided
there is no payment of any monetary compensation in connection with
the exchange of copyrighted works.

     c. If you distribute,
publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the

Work, at a minimum such credit will appear where any other comparable
authorship credit appears and in a manner at least as prominent as
such other comparable authorship credit.

     d. For the avoidance of
doubt, where the Work is a musical composition:

exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a performance

exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a music rights
agency or designated agent (e.g. Harry Fox Agency), royalties for any
phonorecord You create from the Work (""cover version"") and distribute,

US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions), if Your
distribution of such cover version is primarily intended for or
directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary
compensation.

     e. Webcasting Rights and Statutory Royalties. For
the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a sound recording, Licensor
reserves the exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a
performance-rights society (e.g. SoundExchange), royalties for the
public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work, subject to the
compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 114 of the US Copyright
Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions), if Your public digital
performance is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial
advantage or private monetary compensation.

PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER
DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR
NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF
IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under
different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time;
provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw

be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will
continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated
above.

8. Miscellaneous

     a. Each time You distribute or publicly

copyrighted works by means of digital file-sharing or otherwise shall
not be considered to be intended for or directed toward commercial
advantage or private monetary compensation, provided there is no
payment of any monetary compensation in connection with the exchange
of copyrighted works.

     c. If you distribute, publicly display,
publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work, You must
keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable
to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original
Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or (ii) if the
Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties
(e.g. a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution
in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other
reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; the title of the
Work if supplied; and to the extent reasonably practicable, the
Uniform Resource Identifier, if any, that Licensor specifies to be
associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the
copyright notice or licensing information for the Work. Such credit
may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that
in the case of a Collective Work, at a minimum such credit will appear
where any other comparable authorship credit appears and in a manner
at least as prominent as such other comparable authorship credit.

   
 d. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical
composition:

          i. Performance Royalties Under Blanket
Licenses. Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect, whether
individually or via a performance rights society (e.g. ASCAP, BMI,
SESAC), royalties for the public performance or public digital
performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work if that performance is
primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or
private monetary compensation.

          ii. Mechanical Rights and
Statutory Royalties. Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect,
whether individually or via a music rights agency or designated agent
(e.g. Harry Fox Agency), royalties for any phonorecord You create from
the Work (""cover version"") and distribute, subject to the compulsory
license created by 17 USC Section 115 of the US Copyright Act (or the
equivalent in other jurisdictions), if Your distribution of such cover
version is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial
advantage or private monetary compensation.

     e. Webcasting Rights
and Statutory Royalties. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is
a sound recording, Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect,
whether individually or via a performance-rights society (e.g.
SoundExchange), royalties for the public digital performance (e.g.
webcast) of the Work, subject to the compulsory license created by 17
USC Section 114 of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other
jurisdictions), if Your public digital performance is primarily
intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private
monetary compensation.

5. Representations, Warranties and
Disclaimer

UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED BY THE PARTIES IN
WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS
OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED,
STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF
TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE,
NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY,
OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE.
SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES,
SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

6. Limitation on Liability.
EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL
LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL,
INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT
OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN
ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. Termination

     a.
This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License.
Individuals or entities who have received Collective Works from You
under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated
provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with
those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any
termination of this License.

     b. Subject to the above terms and
conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of
the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above,
Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different
license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided,
however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License
(or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted
under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in
full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.

8.
Miscellaneous

     a. Each time You distribute or publicly digitally
perform the Work or a Collective Work, the Licensor offers to the
recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as
the license granted to You under this License.

     b. If any
provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable
law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the
remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by
the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the
minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and
enforceable.

     c. No term or provision of this License shall be
deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent
shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such
waiver or consent.

     d. This License constitutes the entire
agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here.
There are no understandings, agreements or representations with
respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by
any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from
You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written
agreement of the Licensor and You. 

Creative Commons is not a party
to this License, and makes no warranty whatsoever in connection with

arising in connection to this license. Notwithstanding the foregoing
two (2) sentences, if Creative Commons has expressly identified itself
as the Licensor hereunder, it shall have all rights and obligations of
Licensor.

Except for the limited purpose of indicating to the public
that the Work is licensed under the CCPL, neither party will use the
trademark ""Creative Commons"" or any related trademark or logo of
Creative Commons without the prior written consent of Creative
Commons. Any permitted use will be in compliance with Creative

includes cinematographic adaptations or any other form in which the
Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted including in any form

broadcasts, or other works or subject matter other than works listed
in Section 1(f) below, which, by reason of the selection and

which the Work is included in its entirety in unmodified form along
with one or more other contributions, each constituting separate and

collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collection will not be
considered an Adaptation (as defined above) for the purposes of this

at a place individually chosen by them; to perform the Work to the

the performances of the Work, including by public digital performance;
to broadcast and rebroadcast the Work by any means including signs,
sounds or images.

     i. ""Reproduce"" means to make copies of the
Work by any means including without limitation by sound or visual
recordings and the right of fixation and reproducing fixations of the

2. Fair Dealing Rights.
Nothing in this License is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any
uses free from copyright or rights arising from limitations or
exceptions that are provided for in connection with the copyright
protection under copyright law or other applicable laws.

3. License
Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor
hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual
(for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the
rights in the Work as stated below:

     a. to Reproduce the Work, to
incorporate the Work into one or more Collections, and to Reproduce
the Work as incorporated in the Collections; and,

     b. to
Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated in
Collections.

The above rights may be exercised in all media and
formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above rights
include the right to make such modifications as are technically
necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats, but
otherwise you have no rights to make Adaptations. Subject to 8(f), all
rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved,
including but not limited to the rights set forth in Section 4(d).

4.
Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made
subject to and limited by the following restrictions:

     a. You may
Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of this
License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource
Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You
Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms
on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of
the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that
recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the
Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and
to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You
Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly
Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological
measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the
Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under
the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as
incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection
apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this
License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You
must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit
as required by Section 4(c), as requested.

     b. You may not
exercise any of the rights granted to You in Section 3 above in any
manner that is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial
advantage or private monetary compensation. The exchange of the Work
for other copyrighted works by means of digital file-sharing or
otherwise shall not be considered to be intended for or directed
toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation, provided
there is no payment of any monetary compensation in connection with
the exchange of copyrighted works.

     c. If You Distribute, or
Publicly Perform the Work or Collections, You must, unless a request
has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright
notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means
You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym,
if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or
Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor
institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution (""Attribution
Parties"") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other
reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of
the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the
URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work,
unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing
information for the Work. The credit required by this Section 4(c) may
be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in
the case of a Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a
credit for all contributing authors of Collection appears, then as
part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the
credits for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of
doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section for the
purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising
Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly
assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the
Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate,
of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express prior
written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution
Parties.

     d. For the avoidance of doubt:

          i.
Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in
which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or
compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves
the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You
of the rights granted under this License;

          ii. Waivable
Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right
to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing
scheme can be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to
collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted
under this License if Your exercise of such rights is for a purpose or
use which is otherwise than noncommercial as permitted under Section
4(b) and otherwise waives the right to collect royalties through any
statutory or compulsory licensing scheme; and,

          iii.
Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor reserves the right to collect
royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is
a member of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing
schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the rights
granted under this License that is for a purpose or use which is
otherwise than noncommercial as permitted under Section 4(b).

     e.
Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be
otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or
Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any
Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other
derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial
to the Original Author's honor or reputation.

5. Representations,
Warranties and Disclaimer

UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED BY THE
PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO
REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK,
EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER
DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR
NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF
IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

6.
Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE
LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY
FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY
DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF
LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7.
Termination

     a. This License and the rights granted hereunder
will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of
this License. Individuals or entities who have received Collections
from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses
terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full
compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will
survive any termination of this License.

     b. Subject to the above
terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the
duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the
above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different
license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided,
however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License
(or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted
under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in
full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.

8.
Miscellaneous

     a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform
the Work or a Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a
license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license
granted to You under this License.

     b. If any provision of this
License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not
affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of
this License, and without further action by the parties to this
agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent
necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.

     c. No
term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach
consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and
signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.

    
d. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties
with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings,
agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified
here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that
may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be
modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and
You.

     e. The rights granted under, and the subject matter
referenced, in this License were drafted utilizing the terminology of
the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works
(as amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the
WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms
Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on
July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter take effect in the
relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be
enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the
implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable national
law. If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable
copyright law includes additional rights not granted under this
License, such additional rights are deemed to be included in the
License; this License is not intended to restrict the license of any
rights under applicable law.

  Creative Commons Corporation (“Creative Commons”)

Distribution of Creative Commons public licenses does not create a
lawyer-client or other relationship. Creative Commons makes its
licenses and related information available on an “as-is” basis.

Using
Creative Commons Public Licenses

Creative Commons public licenses
provide a standard set of terms and conditions that creators and other
rights holders may use to share original works of authorship and other
material subject to copyright and certain other rights specified in
the public license below. The following considerations are for
informational purposes only, are not exhaustive, and do not form part
of our licenses.

Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses
are intended for use by those authorized to give the public permission
to use material in ways otherwise restricted by copyright and certain
other rights. Our licenses are irrevocable. Licensors should read and
understand the terms and conditions of the license they choose before
applying it. Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before
applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the material as
expected. Licensors should clearly mark any material not subject to
the license. This includes other CC-licensed material, or material
used under an exception or limitation to copyright. More
considerations for licensors.

Considerations for the public: By using
one of our public licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to
use the licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If the
licensor’s permission is not necessary for any reason–for example,
because of any applicable exception or limitation to copyright–then
that use is not regulated by the license. Our licenses grant only
permissions under copyright and certain other rights that a licensor
has authority to grant. Use of the licensed material may still be
restricted for other reasons, including because others have copyright
or other rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests,
such as asking that all changes be marked or described. Although not
required by our licenses, you are encouraged to respect those requests
where reasonable. More considerations for the public. 

Creative

By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You
accept and agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this
Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0
International Public License (""Public License""). To the extent this
Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are granted the
Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of these terms and
conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in consideration
of benefits the Licensor receives from making the Licensed Material
available under these terms and conditions.

Section 1 –
Definitions.
	
     a.	Adapted Material means material subject to
Copyright and Similar Rights that is derived from or based upon the
Licensed Material and in which the Licensed Material is translated,
altered, arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner
requiring permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by

Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording, Adapted
Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is synched in
timed relation with a moving image.
	
     b.	Copyright and Similar
Rights means copyright and/or similar rights closely related to
copyright including, without limitation, performance, broadcast, sound
recording, and Sui Generis Database Rights, without regard to how the

License, the rights specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright
and Similar Rights.
	
     c.	Effective Technological Measures means
those measures that, in the absence of proper authority, may not be
circumvented under laws fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the
WIPO Copyright Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar
international agreements.
	
     d.	Exceptions and Limitations means
fair use, fair dealing, and/or any other exception or limitation to
Copyright and Similar Rights that applies to Your use of the Licensed
Material.
	
     e.	Licensed Material means the artistic or literary
work, database, or other material to which the Licensor applied this
Public License.
	
     f.	Licensed Rights means the rights granted to
You subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, which

of the Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to
license.
	
     g.	Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies)
granting rights under this Public License.
	
     h.	NonCommercial
means not primarily intended for or directed towards commercial
advantage or monetary compensation. For purposes of this Public
License, the exchange of the Licensed Material for other material
subject to Copyright and Similar Rights by digital file-sharing or
similar means is NonCommercial provided there is no payment of
monetary compensation in connection with the exchange.
	
     i.	Share
means to provide material to the public by any means or process that
requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such as reproduction,
public display, public performance, distribution, dissemination,
communication, or importation, and to make material available to the
public including in ways that members of the public may access the
material from a place and at a time individually chosen by them.
	
   
 j.	Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright
resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the
Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, as
amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially equivalent
rights anywhere in the world.
	
     k.	You means the individual or
entity exercising the Licensed Rights under this Public License. Your
has a corresponding meaning.

Section 2 – Scope.
	
     a.	License
grant.
	
          1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Public License, the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide,
royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to
exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:

           
   A. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part,
for NonCommercial purposes only; and

               B. produce and
reproduce, but not Share, Adapted Material for NonCommercial purposes
only.
	
          2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of
doubt, where Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public
License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with its terms
and conditions.
	
          3. Term. The term of this Public License
is specified in Section 6(a).
	
          4. Media and formats;
technical modifications allowed. The Licensor authorizes You to
exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats whether now
known or hereafter created, and to make technical modifications
necessary to do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert
any right or authority to forbid You from making technical
modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including
technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective
Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License, simply
making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)(4) never produces
Adapted Material.
	
          5. Downstream recipients.
              
A. Offer from the Licensor – Licensed Material. Every recipient of
the Licensed Material automatically receives an offer from the
Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights under the terms and
conditions of this Public License.
	
               B. No downstream
restrictions. You may not offer or impose any additional or different
terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures
to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the
Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed Material.
	
         
6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may
be construed as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that
Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected with, or sponsored,
endorsed, or granted official status by, the Licensor or others
designated to receive attribution as provided in Section
3(a)(1)(A)(i).
	
     b.	Other rights.
	
          1. Moral rights,
such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this Public
License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar personality
rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or
agrees not to assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the
limited extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights,
but not otherwise.
	
          2. Patent and trademark rights are not
licensed under this Public License.
	
          3. To the extent
possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect royalties from You
for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether directly or through a
collecting society under any voluntary or waivable statutory or
compulsory licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly
reserves any right to collect such royalties, including when the
Licensed Material is used other than for NonCommercial
purposes.

Section 3 – License Conditions.

Your exercise of the
Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the following
conditions.

     a.	Attribution.
	
          1. If You Share the
Licensed Material, You must:

               A. retain the following
if it is supplied by the Licensor with the Licensed Material:

       
            i.	identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed
Material and any others designated to receive attribution, in any
reasonable manner requested by the Licensor (including by pseudonym if
designated);

                    ii.	a copyright notice;

           
        iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;

           
        iv.	a notice that refers to the disclaimer of warranties;

   
                v.	a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the
extent reasonably practicable;
	
               B. indicate if You
modified the Licensed Material and retain an indication of any
previous modifications; and

               C. indicate the Licensed
Material is licensed under this Public License, and include the text
of, or the URI or hyperlink to, this Public License.
	
          2.
For the avoidance of doubt, You do not have permission under this
Public License to Share Adapted Material.
	
          3. You may
satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any reasonable manner
based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share the
Licensed Material. For example, it may be reasonable to satisfy the
conditions by providing a URI or hyperlink to a resource that includes
the required information.
	
          4. If requested by the Licensor,
You must remove any of the information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A)
to the extent reasonably practicable.

Section 4 – Sui Generis
Database Rights.

Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis
Database Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:

    
a.	for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to
extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of
the contents of the database for NonCommercial purposes only and
provided You do not Share Adapted Material;
	
     b.	if You include
all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a database in
which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in which
You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents)
is Adapted Material; and
	
     c.	You must comply with the conditions
in Section 3(a) if You Share all or a substantial portion of the
contents of the database.
For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4
supplements and does not replace Your obligations under this Public
License where the Licensed Rights include other Copyright and Similar
Rights.

Section 5 – Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of
Liability.
	
     a.	Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the
Licensor, to the extent possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed
Material as-is and as-available, and makes no representations or
warranties of any kind concerning the Licensed Material, whether
express, implied, statutory, or other. This includes, without
limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a
particular purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other
defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence of errors, whether or
not known or discoverable. Where disclaimers of warranties are not
allowed in full or in part, this disclaimer may not apply to You.
	
  
  b.	To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable
to You on any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence)
or otherwise for any direct, special, indirect, incidental,
consequential, punitive, exemplary, or other losses, costs, expenses,
or damages arising out of this Public License or use of the Licensed
Material, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of
such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where a limitation of
liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not
apply to You.
	
     c.	The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of
liability provided above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the
extent possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and
waiver of all liability.

Section 6 – Term and Termination.
	
    
a.	This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and
Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this
Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate
automatically.
	
     b.	Where Your right to use the Licensed Material
has terminated under Section 6(a), it reinstates:
	
          1.
automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is
cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or
	
        
 2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.
	
     c.	For the
avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the
Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public
License.
	
     d.	For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also
offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop
distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will
not terminate this Public License.
	
     e.	Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and
8 survive termination of this Public License.

Section 7 – Other
Terms and Conditions.
	
     a.	The Licensor shall not be bound by any
additional or different terms or conditions communicated by You unless
expressly agreed.
	
     b.	Any arrangements, understandings, or
agreements regarding the Licensed Material not stated herein are
separate from and independent of the terms and conditions of this
Public License.

Section 8 – Interpretation.
	
     a.	For the
avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not be
interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any
use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without
permission under this Public License.
	
     b.	To the extent
possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed
unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum
extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be
reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License without
affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions.
	

    c.	No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and
no failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the
Licensor.
	
     d.	Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may
be interpreted as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and
immunities that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal
processes of any jurisdiction or authority.

License

THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW)
IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE
(""CCPL"" OR ""LICENSE""). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER
APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER
THIS LICENSE IS PROHIBITED.

BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK
PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS
LICENSE. THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN
CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.

1.
Definitions

     a. ""Collective Work"" means a work, such as a
periodical issue, anthology or encyclopedia, in which the Work in its
entirety in unmodified form, along with a number of other
contributions, constituting separate and independent works in
themselves, are assembled into a collective whole. A work that
constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work
(as defined below) for the purposes of this License.

     b.
""Derivative Work"" means a work based upon the Work or upon the Work
and other pre-existing works, such as a translation, musical
arrangement, dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture version,
sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment, condensation, or any
other form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted,
except that a work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be
considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License.

     c.
""Licensor"" means the individual or entity that offers the Work under
the terms of this License.

     d. ""Original Author"" means the
individual or entity who created the Work.

     e. ""Work"" means the
copyrightable work of authorship offered under the terms of this
License.

     f. ""You"" means an individual or entity exercising
rights under this License who has not previously violated the terms of
this License with respect to the Work, or who has received express
permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License
despite a previous violation.

2. Fair Use Rights. Nothing in this
license is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any rights arising
from fair use, first sale or other limitations on the exclusive rights
of the copyright owner under copyright law or other applicable
laws.

3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
License, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable
copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work as stated
below:

     a. to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into
one or more Collective Works, and to reproduce the Work as
incorporated in the Collective Works;

     b. to create and reproduce
Derivative Works;

     c. to distribute copies or phonorecords of,
display publicly, perform publicly, and perform publicly by means of a
digital audio transmission the Work including as incorporated in
Collective Works;

     d. to distribute copies or phonorecords of,
display publicly, perform publicly, and perform publicly by means of a
digital audio transmission Derivative Works;

The above rights may be
exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter
devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications
as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and
formats. All rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby
reserved.

4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is
expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:


    a. You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or
publicly digitally perform the Work only under the terms of this
License, and You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource
Identifier for, this License with every copy or phonorecord of the
Work You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly
digitally perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work
that alter or restrict the terms of this License or the recipients'
exercise of the rights granted hereunder. You may not sublicense the
Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and
to the disclaimer of warranties. You may not distribute, publicly
display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work with
any technological measures that control access or use of the Work in a
manner inconsistent with the terms of this License Agreement. The
above applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collective Work, but
this does not require the Collective Work apart from the Work itself
to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a
Collective Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent
practicable, remove from the Collective Work any reference to such
Licensor or the Original Author, as requested. If You create a
Derivative Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent
practicable, remove from the Derivative Work any reference to such
Licensor or the Original Author, as requested.

     b. You may
distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally
perform a Derivative Work only under the terms of this License, and
You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for,
this License with every copy or phonorecord of each Derivative Work
You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly
digitally perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the
Derivative Works that alter or restrict the terms of this License or
the recipients' exercise of the rights granted hereunder, and You must
keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the
disclaimer of warranties. You may not distribute, publicly display,
publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Derivative Work
with any technological measures that control access or use of the Work
in a manner inconsistent with the terms of this License Agreement. The
above applies to the Derivative Work as incorporated in a Collective
Work, but this does not require the Collective Work apart from the
Derivative Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this
License.

     c. You may not exercise any of the rights granted to
You in Section 3 above in any manner that is primarily intended for or
directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation.
The exchange of the Work for other copyrighted works by means of
digital file-sharing or otherwise shall not be considered to be
intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private
monetary compensation, provided there is no payment of any monetary
compensation in connection with the exchange of copyrighted works.

  
  d. If you distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or
publicly digitally perform the Work or any Derivative Works or
Collective Works, You must keep intact all copyright notices for the
Work and give the Original Author credit reasonable to the medium or
means You are utilizing by conveying the name (or pseudonym if
applicable) of the Original Author if supplied; the title of the Work
if supplied; in the case of a Derivative Work, a credit identifying
the use of the Work in the Derivative Work (e.g., ""French translation
of the Work by Original Author,"" or ""Screenplay based on original Work
by Original Author""). Such credit may be implemented in any reasonable
manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Derivative Work or
Collective Work, at a minimum such credit will appear where any other
comparable authorship credit appears and in a manner at least as
prominent as such other comparable authorship credit.

5.
Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer

     a. By offering the
Work for public release under this License, Licensor represents and
warrants that, to the best of Licensor's knowledge after reasonable
inquiry:

          i. Licensor has secured all rights in the Work
necessary to grant the license rights hereunder and to permit the
lawful exercise of the rights granted hereunder without You having any
obligation to pay any royalties, compulsory license fees, residuals or
any other payments;

          ii. The Work does not infringe the
copyright, trademark, publicity rights, common law rights or any other
right of any third party or constitute defamation, invasion of privacy
or other tortious injury to any third party.

     b. EXCEPT AS
EXPRESSLY STATED IN THIS LICENSE OR OTHERWISE AGREED IN WRITING OR
REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE WORK IS LICENSED ON AN ""AS IS"" BASIS,
WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING,
WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES REGARDING THE CONTENTS OR ACCURACY
OF THE WORK.

6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT
REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, AND EXCEPT FOR DAMAGES ARISING FROM
LIABILITY TO A THIRD PARTY RESULTING FROM BREACH OF THE WARRANTIES IN
SECTION 5, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL
THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK,
EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES.

7. Termination

     a. This License and the rights granted
hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the
terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received
Derivative Works or Collective Works from You under this License,
however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such
individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses.
Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this
License.

     b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the
license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable
copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves
the right to release the Work under different license terms or to stop
distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such
election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license
that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this
License), and this License will continue in full force and effect
unless terminated as stated above.

8. Miscellaneous

     a. Each
time You distribute or publicly digitally perform the Work or a
Collective Work, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the
Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You
under this License.

     b. Each time You distribute or publicly
digitally perform a Derivative Work, Licensor offers to the recipient
a license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the
license granted to You under this License.

     c. If any provision
of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it
shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of
the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties
to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum
extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.

    
d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no
breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing
and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.

  
  e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties
with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings,
agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified
here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that
may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be
modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.


Creative Commons is not a party to this License, and makes no
warranty whatsoever in connection with the Work. Creative Commons will
not be liable to You or any party on any legal theory for any damages
whatsoever, including without limitation any general, special,
incidental or consequential damages arising in connection to this
license. Notwithstanding the foregoing two (2) sentences, if Creative
Commons has expressly identified itself as the Licensor hereunder, it
shall have all rights and obligations of Licensor.

Except for the
limited purpose of indicating to the public that the Work is licensed
under the CCPL, neither party will use the trademark ""Creative
Commons"" or any related trademark or logo of Creative Commons without
the prior written consent of Creative Commons. Any permitted use will
be in compliance with Creative Commons' then-current trademark usage
guidelines, as may be published on its website or otherwise made

TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE

except that a work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be
considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License. For the
avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical composition or sound

purpose of this License.

attributes as selected by Licensor and indicated in the title of this
License: Attribution, Noncommercial, ShareAlike.

2. Fair Use Rights.
Nothing in this license is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any
rights arising from fair use, first sale or other limitations on the
exclusive rights of the copyright owner under copyright law or other
applicable laws.

3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and
conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide,
royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the
applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work as
stated below:

     a. to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work
into one or more Collective Works, and to reproduce the Work as

digital audio transmission Derivative Works;

The above rights may be
exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter
devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications
as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and
formats. All rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby
reserved, including but not limited to the rights set forth in
Sections 4(e) and 4(f).

4. Restrictions. The license granted in
Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the
following restrictions:

     a. You may distribute, publicly display,
publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work only under
the terms of this License, and You must include a copy of, or the
Uniform Resource Identifier for, this License with every copy or
phonorecord of the Work You distribute, publicly display, publicly
perform, or publicly digitally perform. You may not offer or impose
any terms on the Work that alter or restrict the terms of this License
or the recipients' exercise of the rights granted hereunder. You may
not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer
to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties. You may not
distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally

or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with the terms of this
License Agreement. The above applies to the Work as incorporated in a
Collective Work, but this does not require the Collective Work apart
from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License.
If You create a Collective Work, upon notice from any Licensor You
must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collective Work any
reference to such Licensor or the Original Author, as requested. If
You create a Derivative Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must,
to the extent practicable, remove from the Derivative Work any
reference to such Licensor or the Original Author, as requested.

    
b. You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly
digitally perform a Derivative Work only under the terms of this
License, a later version of this License with the same License
Elements as this License, or a Creative Commons iCommons license that

Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 2.0 Japan). You must include a
copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this License or other
license specified in the previous sentence with every copy or
phonorecord of each Derivative Work You distribute, publicly display,
publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform. You may not offer or
impose any terms on the Derivative Works that alter or restrict the
terms of this License or the recipients' exercise of the rights
granted hereunder, and You must keep intact all notices that refer to
this License and to the disclaimer of warranties. You may not
distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally
perform the Derivative Work with any technological measures that
control access or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with the
terms of this License Agreement. The above applies to the Derivative
Work as incorporated in a Collective Work, but this does not require
the Collective Work apart from the Derivative Work itself to be made
subject to the terms of this License.

     c. You may not exercise
any of the rights granted to You in Section 3 above in any manner that
is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or
private monetary compensation. The exchange of the Work for other
copyrighted works by means of digital file-sharing or otherwise shall
not be considered to be intended for or directed toward commercial
advantage or private monetary compensation, provided there is no
payment of any monetary compensation in connection with the exchange
of copyrighted works.

     d. If you distribute, publicly display,
publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work or any
Derivative Works or Collective Works, You must keep intact all
copyright notices for the Work and give the Original Author credit
reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing by conveying the
name (or pseudonym if applicable) of the Original Author if supplied;
the title of the Work if supplied; to the extent reasonably
practicable, the Uniform Resource Identifier, if any, that Licensor
specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not
refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work;
and in the case of a Derivative Work, a credit identifying the use of
the Work in the Derivative Work (e.g., ""French translation of the Work
by Original Author,"" or ""Screenplay based on original Work by Original
Author""). Such credit may be implemented in any reasonable manner;
provided, however, that in the case of a Derivative Work or Collective
Work, at a minimum such credit will appear where any other comparable
authorship credit appears and in a manner at least as prominent as
such other comparable authorship credit.

     e. For the avoidance of
doubt, where the Work is a musical composition:

          i.
Performance Royalties Under Blanket Licenses. Licensor reserves the
exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a performance
rights society (e.g. ASCAP, BMI, SESAC), royalties for the public
performance or public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work
if that performance is primarily intended for or directed toward
commercial advantage or private monetary compensation.

          ii.
Mechanical Rights and Statutory Royalties. Licensor reserves the
exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a music rights
agency or designated agent (e.g. Harry Fox Agency), royalties for any
phonorecord You create from the Work (""cover version"") and distribute,
subject to the compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 115 of the
US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions), if Your
distribution of such cover version is primarily intended for or
directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary
compensation.

     f. Webcasting Rights and Statutory Royalties. For
the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a sound recording, Licensor
reserves the exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a
performance-rights society (e.g. SoundExchange), royalties for the
public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work, subject to the
compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 114 of the US Copyright
Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions), if Your public digital
performance is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial
advantage or private monetary compensation.

5. Representations,
Warranties and Disclaimer

UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE
PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO
REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK,
EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER
DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR
NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF
IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

6.
Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE
LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY
FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY
DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF
LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7.
Termination

     a. This License and the rights granted hereunder
will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of
this License. Individuals or entities who have received Derivative
Works or Collective Works from You under this License, however, will
not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or
entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2,
5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.

     b.
Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is
perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work).
Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the
Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at
any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to
withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is
required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this
License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as
stated above.

8. Miscellaneous

     a. Each time You distribute or
publicly digitally perform the Work or a Collective Work, the Licensor
offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and
conditions as the license granted to You under this License.

     b.
Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform a Derivative
Work, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work
on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under
this License.

     c. If any provision of this License is invalid or
unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity
or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and
without further action by the parties to this agreement, such
provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make
such provision valid and enforceable.

     d. No term or provision of
this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless
such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to
be charged with such waiver or consent.

     e. This License
constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to
the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or
representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor
shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any
communication from You. This License may not be modified without the
mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.

foregoing two (2) sentences, if Creative Commons has expressly
identified itself as the Licensor hereunder, it shall have all rights

License

THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW)
IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE
(""CCPL"" OR ""LICENSE""). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER
APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER
THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.

BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS
TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE
TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED
HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND
CONDITIONS.

1. Definitions

     a. ""Collective Work"" means a work,
such as a periodical issue, anthology or encyclopedia, in which the
Work in its entirety in unmodified form, along with a number of other
contributions, constituting separate and independent works in
themselves, are assembled into a collective whole. A work that
constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work
(as defined below) for the purposes of this License.

     b.
""Derivative Work"" means a work based upon the Work or upon the Work
and other pre-existing works, such as a translation, musical
arrangement, dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture version,
sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment, condensation, or any
other form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted,
except that a work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be
considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License. For the
avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical composition or sound
recording, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a
moving image (""synching"") will be considered a Derivative Work for the
purpose of this License.

     c. ""Licensor"" means the individual or
entity that offers the Work under the terms of this License.

     d.
""Original Author"" means the individual or entity who created the
Work.

     e. ""Work"" means the copyrightable work of authorship
offered under the terms of this License.

     f. ""You"" means an
individual or entity exercising rights under this License who has not
previously violated the terms of this License with respect to the
Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to
exercise rights under this License despite a previous violation.

    
g. ""License Elements"" means the following high-level license
attributes as selected by Licensor and indicated in the title of this
License: Attribution, Noncommercial, ShareAlike.

2. Fair Use Rights.
Nothing in this license is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any
rights arising from fair use, first sale or other limitations on the
exclusive rights of the copyright owner under copyright law or other
applicable laws.

3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and
conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide,
royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the
applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work as
stated below:

     a. to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work
into one or more Collective Works, and to reproduce the Work as
incorporated in the Collective Works;

     b. to create and reproduce
Derivative Works;

     c. to distribute copies or phonorecords of,
display publicly, perform publicly, and perform publicly by means of a
digital audio transmission the Work including as incorporated in
Collective Works;

     d. to distribute copies or phonorecords of,
display publicly, perform publicly, and perform publicly by means of a
digital audio transmission Derivative Works;

The above rights may be
exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter
devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications
as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and
formats. All rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby
reserved, including but not limited to the rights set forth in
Sections 4(e) and 4(f).

4. Restrictions. The license granted in
Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the
following restrictions:

     a. You may distribute, publicly display,
publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work only under
the terms of this License, and You must include a copy of, or the
Uniform Resource Identifier for, this License with every copy or
phonorecord of the Work You distribute, publicly display, publicly
perform, or publicly digitally perform. You may not offer or impose
any terms on the Work that alter or restrict the terms of this License
or the recipients' exercise of the rights granted hereunder. You may
not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer
to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties. You may not
distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally
perform the Work with any technological measures that control access
or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with the terms of this
License Agreement. The above applies to the Work as incorporated in a
Collective Work, but this does not require the Collective Work apart
from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License.
If You create a Collective Work, upon notice from any Licensor You
must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collective Work any
credit as required by clause 4(d), as requested. If You create a
Derivative Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent
practicable, remove from the Derivative Work any credit as required by
clause 4(d), as requested.

     b. You may distribute, publicly
display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform a Derivative
Work only under the terms of this License, a later version of this
License with the same License Elements as this License, or a Creative
Commons iCommons license that contains the same License Elements as
this License (e.g. Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 2.5 Japan).
You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for,
this License or other license specified in the previous sentence with
every copy or phonorecord of each Derivative Work You distribute,
publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform. You
may not offer or impose any terms on the Derivative Works that alter
or restrict the terms of this License or the recipients' exercise of
the rights granted hereunder, and You must keep intact all notices
that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties. You
may not distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly
digitally perform the Derivative Work with any technological measures
that control access or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with
the terms of this License Agreement. The above applies to the
Derivative Work as incorporated in a Collective Work, but this does
not require the Collective Work apart from the Derivative Work itself
to be made subject to the terms of this License.

     c. You may not
exercise any of the rights granted to You in Section 3 above in any
manner that is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial
advantage or private monetary compensation. The exchange of the Work
for other copyrighted works by means of digital file-sharing or
otherwise shall not be considered to be intended for or directed
toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation, provided
there is no payment of any monetary compensation in connection with
the exchange of copyrighted works.

     d. If you distribute,
publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the
Work or any Derivative Works or Collective Works, You must keep intact
all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the
medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author
(or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or (ii) if the Original
Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g. a
sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution in
Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable
means, the name of such party or parties; the title of the Work if
supplied; to the extent reasonably practicable, the Uniform Resource
Identifier, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the
Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or
licensing information for the Work; and in the case of a Derivative
Work, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Derivative Work
(e.g., ""French translation of the Work by Original Author,"" or
""Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author""). Such credit
may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that
in the case of a Derivative Work or Collective Work, at a minimum such
credit will appear where any other comparable authorship credit
appears and in a manner at least as prominent as such other comparable
authorship credit.

     e. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work
is a musical composition:

          i. Performance Royalties Under
Blanket Licenses. Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect,
whether individually or via a performance rights society (e.g. ASCAP,
BMI, SESAC), royalties for the public performance or public digital
performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work if that performance is
primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or
private monetary compensation.

          ii. Mechanical Rights and
Statutory Royalties. Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect,
whether individually or via a music rights agency or designated agent
(e.g. Harry Fox Agency), royalties for any phonorecord You create from
the Work (""cover version"") and distribute, subject to the compulsory
license created by 17 USC Section 115 of the US Copyright Act (or the
equivalent in other jurisdictions), if Your distribution of such cover
version is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial
advantage or private monetary compensation.

     f. Webcasting Rights
and Statutory Royalties. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is
a sound recording, Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect,
whether individually or via a performance-rights society (e.g.
SoundExchange), royalties for the public digital performance (e.g.
webcast) of the Work, subject to the compulsory license created by 17
USC Section 114 of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other
jurisdictions), if Your public digital performance is primarily
intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private
monetary compensation.

SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES,
SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

6. Limitation on Liability.
EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL
LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL,
INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT
OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN

will survive any termination of this License.

above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for
the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding
the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under
different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time;
provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw

includes cinematographic adaptations or any other form in which the
Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted including in any form
recognizably derived from the original, except that a work that
constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation for the

3. License
Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor
hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual
(for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the
rights in the Work as stated below:

     a. to Reproduce the Work, to
incorporate the Work into one or more Collections, and to Reproduce
the Work as incorporated in the Collections;

     b. to create and
Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such Adaptation, including any
translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps to clearly label,
demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made to the original
Work. For example, a translation could be marked ""The original work
was translated from English to Spanish,"" or a modification could
indicate ""The original work has been modified."";

     c. to
Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated in
Collections; and,

     d. to Distribute and Publicly Perform
Adaptations.

The above rights may be exercised in all media and
formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above rights
include the right to make such modifications as are technically
necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats. Subject
to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly granted by Licensor are
hereby reserved, including but not limited to the rights described in
Section 4(e).

4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above
is expressly made subject to and limited by the following
restrictions:

     a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work
only under the terms of this License. You must include a copy of, or
the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every
copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer
or impose any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this
License or the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the
rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. You
may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that
refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every
copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You
Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any
effective technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability
of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to
that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a)
applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not
require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made subject
to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection, upon notice
from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the
Collection any credit as required by Section 4(d), as requested. If
You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to
the extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as
required by Section 4(d), as requested.

     b. You may Distribute or
Publicly Perform an Adaptation only under: (i) the terms of this
License; (ii) a later version of this License with the same License
Elements as this License; (iii) a Creative Commons jurisdiction
license (either this or a later license version) that contains the
same License Elements as this License (e.g.,
Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 US) (""Applicable License"").
You must include a copy of, or the URI, for Applicable License with
every copy of each Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You
may not offer or impose any terms on the Adaptation that restrict the
terms of the Applicable License or the ability of the recipient of the
Adaptation to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the
terms of the Applicable License. You must keep intact all notices that
refer to the Applicable License and to the disclaimer of warranties
with every copy of the Work as included in the Adaptation You
Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly
Perform the Adaptation, You may not impose any effective technological
measures on the Adaptation that restrict the ability of a recipient of
the Adaptation from You to exercise the rights granted to that
recipient under the terms of the Applicable License. This Section 4(b)
applies to the Adaptation as incorporated in a Collection, but this
does not require the Collection apart from the Adaptation itself to be
made subject to the terms of the Applicable License.

     c. You may
not exercise any of the rights granted to You in Section 3 above in
any manner that is primarily intended for or directed toward
commercial advantage or private monetary compensation. The exchange of
the Work for other copyrighted works by means of digital file-sharing
or otherwise shall not be considered to be intended for or directed
toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation, provided
there is no payment of any monetary compensation in con-nection with
the exchange of copyrighted works.

     d. If You Distribute, or
Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or Collections, You must,
unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact
all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the
medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author
(or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original
Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a
sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution
(""Attribution Parties"") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of
service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or
parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent
reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be
associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the
copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and, (iv)
consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a credit
identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., ""French
translation of the Work by Original Author,"" or ""Screenplay based on
original Work by Original Author""). The credit required by this
Section 4(d) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided,
however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum
such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of
the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these credits
and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other
contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the
credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the
manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this
License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any
connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author,
Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your
use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written
permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution
Parties.

     e. For the avoidance of doubt:

          i.
Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in
which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or
compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves
the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You
of the rights granted under this License;

          ii. Waivable
Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right
to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing
scheme can be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to
collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted
under this License if Your exercise of such rights is for a purpose or
use which is otherwise than noncommercial as permitted under Section
4(c) and otherwise waives the right to collect royalties through any
statutory or compulsory licensing scheme; and,

          iii.
Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor reserves the right to collect
royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is
a member of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing
schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the rights
granted under this License that is for a purpose or use which is
otherwise than noncommercial as permitted under Section 4(c).

     f.
Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be
otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or
Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any
Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or
take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be
prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or reputation. Licensor
agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise
of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to
make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation,
modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original
Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert,
as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the
applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your
right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations)
but not otherwise.

5. Representations, Warranties and
Disclaimer

UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN
WRITING AND TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW,
LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED,
STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF
TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE,
NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY,
OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE.
SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES,
SO THIS EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

6. Limitation on Liability.
EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL
LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL,
INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT
OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN
ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. Termination

     a.
This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License.
Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections
from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses
terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full
compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will
survive any termination of this License.

     b. Subject to the above
terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the
duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the
above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different
license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided,
however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License
(or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted
under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in
full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.

8.
Miscellaneous

     a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform
the Work or a Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a
license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license
granted to You under this License.

     b. Each time You Distribute
or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor offers to the recipient a
license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the
license granted to You under this License.

     c. If any provision
of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it
shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of
the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties
to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum
extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.

    
d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no
breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing
and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.

  
  e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties
with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings,
agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified
here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that
may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be
modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and
You.

     f. The rights granted under, and the subject matter
referenced, in this License were drafted utilizing the terminology of
the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works
(as amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the
WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms
Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on
July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter take effect in the
relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be
enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the
implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable national
law. If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable
copyright law includes additional rights not granted under this
License, such additional rights are deemed to be included in the
License; this License is not intended to restrict the license of any
rights under applicable law.

 Creative Commons Corporation (“Creative Commons”)

Using
Creative Commons Public Licenses

Creative Commons public licenses
provide a standard set of terms and conditions that creators and other
rights holders may use to share original works of authorship and other
material subject to copyright and certain other rights specified in
the public license below. The following considerations are for
informational purposes only, are not exhaustive, and do not form part
of our licenses.

Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses
are intended for use by those authorized to give the public permission
to use material in ways otherwise restricted by copyright and certain
other rights. Our licenses are irrevocable. Licensors should read and
understand the terms and conditions of the license they choose before
applying it. Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before
applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the material as
expected. Licensors should clearly mark any material not subject to
the license. This includes other CC-licensed material, or material
used under an exception or limitation to copyright. More
considerations for licensors.

Considerations for the public: By using
one of our public licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to
use the licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If the
licensor’s permission is not necessary for any reason–for example,
because of any applicable exception or limitation to copyright–then
that use is not regulated by the license. Our licenses grant only
permissions under copyright and certain other rights that a licensor
has authority to grant. Use of the licensed material may still be
restricted for other reasons, including because others have copyright
or other rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests,
such as asking that all changes be marked or described. Although not
required by our licenses, you are encouraged to respect those requests
where reasonable. More considerations for the public. 

Creative
Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International Public
License

By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept
and agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative
Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International Public
License (""Public License""). To the extent this Public License may be
interpreted as a contract, You are granted the Licensed Rights in
consideration of Your acceptance of these terms and conditions, and
the Licensor grants You such rights in consideration of benefits the
Licensor receives from making the Licensed Material available under
these terms and conditions.

Section 1 – Definitions.
	
    
a.	Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar
Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material and in
which the Licensed Material is translated, altered, arranged,
transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring permission
under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the Licensor. For

musical work, performance, or sound recording, Adapted Material is
always produced where the Licensed Material is synched in timed
relation with a moving image.

     e.	Effective

December 20, 1996, and/or similar international agreements.
	
    
f.	Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or any
other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights that
applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.
	
     g.	License
Elements means the license attributes listed in the name of a Creative
Commons Public License. The License Elements of this Public License
are Attribution, NonCommercial, and ShareAlike.

Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.
	
    
j.	Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights
under this Public License.
	
     k.	NonCommercial means not primarily

with the exchange.
	
     l.	Share means to provide material to the
public by any means or process that requires permission under the
Licensed Rights, such as reproduction, public display, public
performance, distribution, dissemination, communication, or

ways that members of the public may access the material from a place
and at a time individually chosen by them.
	
     m.	Sui Generis
Database Rights means rights other than copyright resulting from
Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11
March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, as amended and/or
succeeded, as well as other essentially equivalent rights anywhere in
the world.
	
     n.	You means the individual or entity exercising the
Licensed Rights under this Public License. Your has a corresponding
meaning.

Section 2 – Scope.
	
     a.	License grant.
	
          1.
Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the
Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to exercise the
Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:

               A.
reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part, for

reproduce, and Share Adapted Material for NonCommercial purposes
only.
	
          2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of
doubt, where Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public
License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with its terms
and conditions.
	
          3. Term. The term of this Public License
is specified in Section 6(a).
	
          4. Media and formats;
technical modifications allowed. The Licensor authorizes You to
exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats whether now
known or hereafter created, and to make technical modifications
necessary to do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert
any right or authority to forbid You from making technical
modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including
technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective
Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License, simply
making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)(4) never produces
Adapted Material.
	
          5. Downstream recipients.

             
 A. Offer from the Licensor – Licensed Material. Every recipient of
the Licensed Material automatically receives an offer from the
Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights under the terms and
conditions of this Public License.
	
               B. Additional
offer from the Licensor – Adapted Material. Every recipient of
Adapted Material from You automatically receives an offer from the
Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Adapted Material under
the conditions of the Adapter’s License You apply.
	
              
C. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose any
additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective
Technological Measures to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts
exercise of the Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed
Material.
	
          6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public
License constitutes or may be construed as permission to assert or
imply that You are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is,
connected with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,
the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as provided
in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).
	
     b.	Other rights.
	
          1. Moral
rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this
Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar
personality rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor
waives and/or agrees not to assert any such rights held by the
Licensor to the limited extent necessary to allow You to exercise the
Licensed Rights, but not otherwise.
	
          2. Patent and
trademark rights are not licensed under this Public License.
	
       
  3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect
royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether
directly or through a collecting society under any voluntary or
waivable statutory or compulsory licensing scheme. In all other cases
the Licensor expressly reserves any right to collect such royalties,
including when the Licensed Material is used other than for
NonCommercial purposes.

Section 3 – License Conditions.

Your
exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the
following conditions.

     a.	Attribution.
	
          1. If You
Share the Licensed Material (including in modified form), You must:
	

              A. retain the following if it is supplied by the
Licensor with the Licensed Material:

                   
i.	identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed Material and any
others designated to receive attribution, in any reasonable manner
requested by the Licensor (including by pseudonym if designated);

   
                ii.	a copyright notice;

                    iii. a
notice that refers to this Public License;

                    iv.	a
notice that refers to the disclaimer of warranties;

                 
  v.	a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the extent
reasonably practicable;
	
               B. indicate if You modified
the Licensed Material and retain an indication of any previous
modifications; and
	
               C. indicate the Licensed Material
is licensed under this Public License, and include the text of, or the
URI or hyperlink to, this Public License.
	
          2. You may
satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any reasonable manner
based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share the
Licensed Material. For example, it may be reasonable to satisfy the
conditions by providing a URI or hyperlink to a resource that includes
the required information.
	
          3. If requested by the Licensor,
You must remove any of the information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A)
to the extent reasonably practicable.
	
     b.	ShareAlike.In addition
to the conditions in Section 3(a), if You Share Adapted Material You
produce, the following conditions also apply.
	
          1. The
Adapter’s License You apply must be a Creative Commons license with
the same License Elements, this version or later, or a BY-NC-SA
Compatible License.
	
          2. You must include the text of, or
the URI or hyperlink to, the Adapter's License You apply. You may
satisfy this condition in any reasonable manner based on the medium,
means, and context in which You Share Adapted Material.
	
          3.
You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or
conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to,
Adapted Material that restrict exercise of the rights granted under
the Adapter's License You apply.

Section 4 – Sui Generis Database
Rights.

Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights
that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:
	
     a.	for the
avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to extract,
reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the
contents of the database for NonCommercial purposes only;
	
     b.	if
You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a
database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the
database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its
individual contents) is Adapted Material, including for purposes of
Section 3(b); and
	
     c.	You must comply with the conditions in
Section 3(a) if You Share all or a substantial portion of the contents
of the database.
For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4
supplements and does not replace Your obligations under this Public
License where the Licensed Rights include other Copyright and Similar
Rights.

Section 5 – Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of
Liability.
	
     a.	Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the
Licensor, to the extent possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed
Material as-is and as-available, and makes no representations or
warranties of any kind concerning the Licensed Material, whether
express, implied, statutory, or other. This includes, without
limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a
particular purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other
defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence of errors, whether or
not known or discoverable. Where disclaimers of warranties are not
allowed in full or in part, this disclaimer may not apply to You.
	
  
  b.	To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable
to You on any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence)
or otherwise for any direct, special, indirect, incidental,
consequential, punitive, exemplary, or other losses, costs, expenses,
or damages arising out of this Public License or use of the Licensed
Material, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of
such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where a limitation of
liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not
apply to You.
	
     c.	The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of
liability provided above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the
extent possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and
waiver of all liability.

Section 6 – Term and Termination.
	
    
a.	This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and
Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this
Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate
automatically.
	
     b.	Where Your right to use the Licensed Material
has terminated under Section 6(a), it reinstates:
	
         
1.	automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is
cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or
	
        
 2.	upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.
	
     c.	For the
avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the
Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public
License.
	
     d.	For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also
offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop
distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will
not terminate this Public License.
	
     e.	Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and
8 survive termination of this Public License.

Section 7 – Other
Terms and Conditions.
	
     a.	The Licensor shall not be bound by any
additional or different terms or conditions communicated by You unless
expressly agreed.
	
     b.	Any arrangements, understandings, or
agreements regarding the Licensed Material not stated herein are
separate from and independent of the terms and conditions of this
Public License.

Section 8 – Interpretation.
	
     a.	For the
avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not be
interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any
use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without
permission under this Public License.
	
     b.	To the extent
possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed
unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum
extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be
reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License without
affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions.
	

    c.	No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and
no failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the
Licensor.
	
     d.	Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may
be interpreted as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and
immunities that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal
processes of any jurisdiction or authority.

and other pre-existing works, such as a translation, musical
arrangement, dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture version,

digitally perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work
that alter or restrict the terms of this License or the recipients'
exercise of the rights granted hereunder. You may not sublicense the
Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and
to the disclaimer of warranties. You may not distribute, publicly
display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work with
any technological measures that control access or use of the Work in a
manner inconsistent with the terms of this License Agreement. The
above applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collective Work, but
this does not require the Collective Work apart from the Work itself
to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a
Collective Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent
practicable, remove from the Collective Work any reference to such
Licensor or the Original Author, as requested.

     b. If you
distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally

reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing by conveying the
name (or pseudonym if applicable) of the Original Author if supplied;
the title of the Work if supplied. Such credit may be implemented in
any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a
Collective Work, at a minimum such credit will appear where any other
comparable authorship credit appears and in a manner at least as
prominent as such other comparable authorship credit.

5.
Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer

     a. By offering the

warrants that, to the best of Licensor's knowledge after reasonable
inquiry:

          i. Licensor has secured all rights in the Work
necessary to grant the license rights hereunder and to permit the
lawful exercise of the rights granted hereunder without You having any
obligation to pay any royalties, compulsory license fees, residuals or
any other payments;

          ii. The Work does not infringe the
copyright, trademark, publicity rights, common law rights or any other
right of any third party or constitute defamation, invasion of privacy
or other tortious injury to any third party.

     b. EXCEPT AS
EXPRESSLY STATED IN THIS LICENSE OR OTHERWISE AGREED IN WRITING OR
REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE WORK IS LICENSED ON AN ""AS IS"" BASIS,
WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING,
WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES REGARDING THE CONTENTS OR ACCURACY
OF THE WORK.

6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT
REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, AND EXCEPT FOR DAMAGES ARISING FROM
LIABILITY TO A THIRD PARTY RESULTING FROM BREACH OF THE WARRANTIES IN
SECTION 5, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL
THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK,
EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES.

7. Termination

     a. This License and the rights granted
hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the
terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received
Collective Works from You under this License, however, will not have
their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain
in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8
will survive any termination of this License.

     b. Subject to the
above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for
the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding
the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under
different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time;
provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw
this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to
be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will
continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated
above.

8. Miscellaneous

     a. Each time You distribute or publicly
digitally perform the Work or a Collective Work, the Licensor offers
to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and
conditions as the license granted to You under this License.

     b.
If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under
applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action
by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to
the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and
enforceable.

     c. No term or provision of this License shall be
deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent
shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such
waiver or consent.

     d. This License constitutes the entire
agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here.
There are no understandings, agreements or representations with
respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by
any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from
You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written
agreement of the Licensor and You.

License

THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF
THIS CREATIVE COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE (""CCPL"" OR ""LICENSE""). THE WORK
IS PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE
WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS
PROHIBITED.

BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU
ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. THE
LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR
ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.

1. Definitions

     a.
""Collective Work"" means a work, such as a periodical issue, anthology
or encyclopedia, in which the Work in its entirety in unmodified form,
along with a number of other contributions, constituting separate and
independent works in themselves, are assembled into a collective
whole. A work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be
considered a Derivative Work (as defined below) for the purposes of
this License.

     b. ""Derivative Work"" means a work based upon the
Work or upon the Work and other pre-existing works, such as a
translation, musical arrangement, dramatization, fictionalization,
motion picture version, sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment,
condensation, or any other form in which the Work may be recast,
transformed, or adapted, except that a work that constitutes a
Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work for the
purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is
a musical composition or sound recording, the synchronization of the
Work in timed-relation with a moving image (""synching"") will be
considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License.

     c.
""Licensor"" means the individual or entity that offers the Work under
the terms of this License.

     d. ""Original Author"" means the
individual or entity who created the Work.

     e. ""Work"" means the
copyrightable work of authorship offered under the terms of this
License.

     f. ""You"" means an individual or entity exercising
rights under this License who has not previously violated the terms of
this License with respect to the Work, or who has received express
permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License
despite a previous violation.

2. Fair Use Rights. Nothing in this
license is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any rights arising
from fair use, first sale or other limitations on the exclusive rights
of the copyright owner under copyright law or other applicable
laws.

3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
License, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable
copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work as stated
below:

     a. to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into
one or more Collective Works, and to reproduce the Work as
incorporated in the Collective Works;

     b. to distribute copies or
phonorecords of, display publicly, perform publicly, and perform
publicly by means of a digital audio transmission the Work including
as incorporated in Collective Works.

     c. For the avoidance of
doubt, where the work is a musical composition:

          i.
Performance Royalties Under Blanket Licenses. Licensor waives the
exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a performance
rights society (e.g. ASCAP, BMI, SESAC), royalties for the public
performance or public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the
Work.

          ii. Mechanical Rights and Statutory Royalties.
Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect, whether individually
or via a music rights society or designated agent (e.g. Harry Fox
Agency), royalties for any phonorecord You create from the Work
(""cover version"") and distribute, subject to the compulsory license
created by 17 USC Section 115 of the US Copyright Act (or the
equivalent in other jurisdictions).

     d. Webcasting Rights and
Statutory Royalties. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a
sound recording, Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect,
whether individually or via a performance-rights society (e.g.
SoundExchange), royalties for the public digital performance (e.g.
webcast) of the Work, subject to the compulsory license created by 17
USC Section 114 of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other
jurisdictions).

The above rights may be exercised in all media and
formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above rights
include the right to make such modifications as are technically
necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats, but
otherwise you have no rights to make Derivative Works. All rights not
expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.

4. Restrictions.
The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to
and limited by the following restrictions:

     a. You may
distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally
perform the Work only under the terms of this License, and You must
include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this
License with every copy or phonorecord of the Work You distribute,
publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform. You
may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that alter or restrict
the terms of this License or the recipients' exercise of the rights
granted hereunder. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep
intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of
warranties. You may not distribute, publicly display, publicly
perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work with any technological
measures that control access or use of the Work in a manner
inconsistent with the terms of this License Agreement. The above
applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collective Work, but this
does not require the Collective Work apart from the Work itself to be
made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collective
Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent
practicable, remove from the Collective Work any reference to such
Licensor or the Original Author, as requested.

     b. If you
distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally
perform the Work or Collective Works, You must keep intact all
copyright notices for the Work and give the Original Author credit
reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing by conveying the
name (or pseudonym if applicable) of the Original Author if supplied;
the title of the Work if supplied; and to the extent reasonably
practicable, the Uniform Resource Identifier, if any, that Licensor
specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not
refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work.
Such credit may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided,
however, that in the case of a Collective Work, at a minimum such
credit will appear where any other comparable authorship credit
appears and in a manner at least as prominent as such other comparable
authorship credit.

5. Representations, Warranties and
Disclaimer

UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN
WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS
OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE MATERIALS, EXPRESS, IMPLIED,
STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF
TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE,
NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY,
OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE.
SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES,
SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

6. Limitation on Liability.
EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL
LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL,
INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT
OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN
ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. Termination

     a.
This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License.
Individuals or entities who have received Collective Works from You
under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated
provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with
those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any
termination of this License.

     b. Subject to the above terms and
conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of
the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above,
Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different
license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided,

validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this
License, and without further action by the parties to this agreement,
such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to
make such provision valid and enforceable.

     c. No term or
provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach
consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and
signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent. This
License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with
respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings,
agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified

cinematographic adaptations or any other form in which the Work may be

Nothing in this License is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any

3. License
Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor
hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual
(for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the
rights in the Work as stated below:

     a. to Reproduce the Work, to
incorporate the Work into one or more Collections, and to Reproduce
the Work as incorporated in the Collections; and,

     b. to
Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated in
Collections.

     c. For the avoidance of doubt:

          i.
Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in
which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or
compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves
the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You
of the rights granted under this License;

          ii. Waivable
Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right
to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing
scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the exclusive right to
collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted
under this License; and,

          iii. Voluntary License Schemes.
The Licensor waives the right to collect royalties, whether
individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a member of a
collecting society that administers voluntary licensing schemes, via
that society, from any exercise by You of the rights granted under
this License.

The above rights may be exercised in all media and
formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above rights
include the right to make such modifications as are technically
necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats, but
otherwise you have no rights to make Adaptations. Subject to Section
8(f), all rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby
reserved.

4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is
expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:


    a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the
terms of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform
Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the
Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose
any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the
ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to
that recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense
the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License
and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You
Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly
Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological
measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the
Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under
the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as
incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection
apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this
License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You
must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit
as required by Section 4(b), as requested.

     b. If You Distribute,
or Publicly Perform the Work or Collections, You must, unless a
request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all
copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium
or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or
pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original Author
and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor
institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution (""Attribution
Parties"") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other
reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of
the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the
URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work,
unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing
information for the Work. The credit required by this Section 4(b) may
be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in
the case of a Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a
credit for all contributing authors of the Collection appears, then as
part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the
credits for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of
doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section for the
purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising
Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly
assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the
Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate,
of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express prior
written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution
Parties.

     c. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the
Licensor or as may be otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You
Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or
as part of any Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or
take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be
prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or reputation.

5.
Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer

UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY
AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS
AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE
WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER
DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR
NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF
IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

6.
Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE
LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY
FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY
DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF
LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7.
Termination

     a. This License and the rights granted hereunder
will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of
this License. Individuals or entities who have received Collections
from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses
terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full
compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will
survive any termination of this License.

     b. Subject to the above
terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the
duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the
above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different
license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided,
however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License
(or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted
under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in
full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.

8.
Miscellaneous

     a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform
the Work or a Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a
license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license
granted to You under this License.

     b. If any provision of this
License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not
affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of
this License, and without further action by the parties to this
agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent
necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.

     c. No
term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach
consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and
signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.

    
d. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties
with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings,
agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified
here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that
may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be
modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and
You.

     e. The rights granted under, and the subject matter
referenced, in this License were drafted utilizing the terminology of
the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works
(as amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the
WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms
Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on
July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter take effect in the
relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be
enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the
implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable national
law. If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable
copyright law includes additional rights not granted under this
License, such additional rights are deemed to be included in the
License; this License is not intended to restrict the license of any
rights under applicable law.

Creative Commons Corporation (“Creative Commons”) is not a law

of Creative Commons public licenses does not create a lawyer-client or
other relationship. Creative Commons makes its licenses and related

Using Creative Commons Public
Licenses

Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of
terms and conditions that creators and other rights holders may use to
share original works of authorship and other material subject to
copyright and certain other rights specified in the public license
below. The following considerations are for informational purposes
only, are not exhaustive, and do not form part of our
licenses.

Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are
intended for use by those authorized to give the public permission to
use material in ways otherwise restricted by copyright and certain
other rights. Our licenses are irrevocable. Licensors should read and
understand the terms and conditions of the license they choose before
applying it. Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before
applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the material as
expected. Licensors should clearly mark any material not subject to
the license. This includes other CC-licensed material, or material
used under an exception or limitation to copyright. More
considerations for licensors.

Considerations for the public: By using
one of our public licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to
use the licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If the
licensor’s permission is not necessary for any reason–for example,
because of any applicable exception or limitation to copyright–then
that use is not regulated by the license. Our licenses grant only
permissions under copyright and certain other rights that a licensor
has authority to grant. Use of the licensed material may still be
restricted for other reasons, including because others have copyright
or other rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests,
such as asking that all changes be marked or described. Although not
required by our licenses, you are encouraged to respect those requests
where reasonable. More considerations for the public.  

Creative
Commons Attribution-NoDerivatives 4.0 International Public License

By
exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree
to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons
Attribution-NoDerivatives 4.0 International Public License (""Public
License""). To the extent this Public License may be interpreted as a
contract, You are granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your
acceptance of these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You
such rights in consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from
making the Licensed Material available under these terms and
conditions.

Section 1 – Definitions.

     a.	Adapted Material
means material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights that is derived
from or based upon the Licensed Material and in which the Licensed
Material is translated, altered, arranged, transformed, or otherwise
modified in a manner requiring permission under the Copyright and
Similar Rights held by the Licensor. For purposes of this Public
License, where the Licensed Material is a musical work, performance,
or sound recording, Adapted Material is always produced where the
Licensed Material is synched in timed relation with a moving image.
	

    b.	Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar
rights closely related to copyright including, without limitation,
performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database
Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or categorized.
For purposes of this Public License, the rights specified in Section
2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar Rights.
	
     c.	Effective
Technological Measures means those measures that, in the absence of
proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws fulfilling
obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright Treaty adopted on
December 20, 1996, and/or similar international agreements.
	
    
d.	Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or any
other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights that
applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.
	
     e.	Licensed
Material means the artistic or literary work, database, or other
material to which the Licensor applied this Public License.
	
    
f.	Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the
terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to all
Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed
Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.
	
    
g.	Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights
under this Public License.
	
     h.	Share means to provide material
to the public by any means or process that requires permission under
the Licensed Rights, such as reproduction, public display, public
performance, distribution, dissemination, communication, or
importation, and to make material available to the public including in
ways that members of the public may access the material from a place
and at a time individually chosen by them.
	
     i.	Sui Generis
Database Rights means rights other than copyright resulting from
Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11
March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, as amended and/or
succeeded, as well as other essentially equivalent rights anywhere in
the world.
	
     j.	You means the individual or entity exercising the
Licensed Rights under this Public License. Your has a corresponding
meaning.

Section 2 – Scope.
	
     a.	License grant.
	
          1.
Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the
Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to exercise the
Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:

               A.
reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part; and
	

              B. produce and reproduce, but not Share, Adapted
Material.
	
          2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance
of doubt, where Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this
Public License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with its
terms and conditions.
	
          3. Term. The term of this Public
License is specified in Section 6(a).
	
          4. Media and
formats; technical modifications allowed. The Licensor authorizes You
to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats whether now
known or hereafter created, and to make technical modifications
necessary to do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert
any right or authority to forbid You from making technical
modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including
technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective
Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License, simply
making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)(4) never produces
Adapted Material.
	
          5. Downstream recipients.

             
 A. Offer from the Licensor – Licensed Material. Every recipient of
the Licensed Material automatically receives an offer from the
Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights under the terms and
conditions of this Public License.
	
               B. No downstream
restrictions. You may not offer or impose any additional or different
terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures
to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the
Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed Material.
	
         
6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may
be construed as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that
Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected with, or sponsored,
endorsed, or granted official status by, the Licensor or others
designated to receive attribution as provided in Section
3(a)(1)(A)(i).
	
     b.	Other rights.
	
          1. Moral rights,
such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this Public
License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar personality
rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or
agrees not to assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the
limited extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights,
but not otherwise.
	
          2. Patent and trademark rights are not
licensed under this Public License.
	
          3. To the extent
possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect royalties from You
for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether directly or through a
collecting society under any voluntary or waivable statutory or
compulsory licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly
reserves any right to collect such royalties.

Section 3 – License
Conditions.

Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made
subject to the following conditions.
  
     a.	Attribution.
	
       
  1. If You Share the Licensed Material, You must:

               A.
retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor with the
Licensed Material:

                    i. identification of the
creator(s) of the Licensed Material and any others designated to
receive attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by the
Licensor (including by pseudonym if designated);

                   
ii.	a copyright notice;

                    iii. a notice that refers
to this Public License;

                    iv.	a notice that refers
to the disclaimer of warranties;

                    v.	a URI or
hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the extent reasonably
practicable;
	
               B. indicate if You modified the Licensed
Material and retain an indication of any previous modifications; and


              C. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this
Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to,
this Public License.
	
          2. For the avoidance of doubt, You do
not have permission under this Public License to Share Adapted
Material.
	
          3. You may satisfy the conditions in Section
3(a)(1) in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and
context in which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may
be reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or
hyperlink to a resource that includes the required information.
	
    
     4. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the
information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent reasonably
practicable.

Section 4 – Sui Generis Database Rights.

Where the
Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your
use of the Licensed Material:
	
     a.	for the avoidance of doubt,
Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to extract, reuse, reproduce, and
Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database,
provided You do not Share Adapted Material;
	
     b.	if You include
all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a database in
which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in which
You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents)
is Adapted Material; and
	
     c.	You must comply with the conditions
in Section 3(a) if You Share all or a substantial portion of the
contents of the database.
For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4
supplements and does not replace Your obligations under this Public
License where the Licensed Rights include other Copyright and Similar
Rights.

Section 5 – Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of
Liability.
	
     a.	Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the
Licensor, to the extent possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed
Material as-is and as-available, and makes no representations or
warranties of any kind concerning the Licensed Material, whether
express, implied, statutory, or other. This includes, without
limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a
particular purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other
defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence of errors, whether or
not known or discoverable. Where disclaimers of warranties are not
allowed in full or in part, this disclaimer may not apply to You.
	
  
  b.	To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable
to You on any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence)
or otherwise for any direct, special, indirect, incidental,
consequential, punitive, exemplary, or other losses, costs, expenses,
or damages arising out of this Public License or use of the Licensed
Material, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of
such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where a limitation of
liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not
apply to You.
	
     c.	The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of
liability provided above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the
extent possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and
waiver of all liability.

Section 6 – Term and Termination.
	
    
a.	This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and
Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this
Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate
automatically.
	
     b.	Where Your right to use the Licensed Material
has terminated under Section 6(a), it reinstates:
	
          1.
automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is
cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or
         

          2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.
	
    
c.	For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any
right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of
this Public License.
	
     d.	For the avoidance of doubt, the
Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or
conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time;
however, doing so will not terminate this Public License.
	
    
e.	Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public
License.

Section 7 – Other Terms and Conditions.
	
     a.	The
Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or
conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.
	
     b.	Any
arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed
Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the
terms and conditions of this Public License.

Section 8 –
Interpretation.
	
     a.	For the avoidance of doubt, this Public
License does not, and shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit,
restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the Licensed Material
that could lawfully be made without permission under this Public
License.
	
     b.	To the extent possible, if any provision of this
Public License is deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically
reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If
the provision cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public
License without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms
and conditions.
	
     c.	No term or condition of this Public License
will be waived and no failure to comply consented to unless expressly
agreed to by the Licensor.
	
     d.	Nothing in this Public License
constitutes or may be interpreted as a limitation upon, or waiver of,
any privileges and immunities that apply to the Licensor or You,
including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction or
authority.

RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH
TERMS AND CONDITIONS.

1. Definitions

     a. ""Collective Work"" means
a work, such as a periodical issue, anthology or encyclopedia, in
which the Work in its entirety in unmodified form, along with a number
of other contributions, constituting separate and independent works in
themselves, are assembled into a collective whole. A work that
constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work
(as defined below) for the purposes of this License.

     b.
""Derivative Work"" means a work based upon the Work or upon the Work
and other pre-existing works, such as a translation, musical
arrangement, dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture version,
sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment, condensation, or any
other form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted,
except that a work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be
considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License.

     c.
""Licensor"" means the individual or entity that offers the Work under
the terms of this License.

     d. ""Original Author"" means the
individual or entity who created the Work.

     e. ""Work"" means the
copyrightable work of authorship offered under the terms of this
License.

     f. ""You"" means an individual or entity exercising
rights under this License who has not previously violated the terms of
this License with respect to the Work, or who has received express
permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License
despite a previous violation.

2. Fair Use Rights. Nothing in this
license is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any rights arising
from fair use, first sale or other limitations on the exclusive rights
of the copyright owner under copyright law or other applicable
laws.

3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
License, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable
copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work as stated
below:

     a. to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into
one or more Collective Works, and to reproduce the Work as
incorporated in the Collective Works;

     b. to create and reproduce
Derivative Works;

     c. to distribute copies or phonorecords of,
display publicly, perform publicly, and perform publicly by means of a
digital audio transmission the Work including as incorporated in
Collective Works;

     d. to distribute copies or phonorecords of,
display publicly, perform publicly, and perform publicly by means of a
digital audio transmission Derivative Works;

The above rights may be
exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter
devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications
as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and
formats. All rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby
reserved.

4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is
expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:


    a. You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or
publicly digitally perform the Work only under the terms of this
License, and You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource
Identifier for, this License with every copy or phonorecord of the
Work You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly
digitally perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work
that alter or restrict the terms of this License or the recipients'
exercise of the rights granted hereunder. You may not sublicense the
Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and
to the disclaimer of warranties. You may not distribute, publicly
display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work with
any technological measures that control access or use of the Work in a
manner inconsistent with the terms of this License Agreement. The
above applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collective Work, but
this does not require the Collective Work apart from the Work itself
to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a
Collective Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent
practicable, remove from the Collective Work any reference to such
Licensor or the Original Author, as requested. If You create a
Derivative Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent
practicable, remove from the Derivative Work any reference to such
Licensor or the Original Author, as requested.

     b. You may
distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally
perform a Derivative Work only under the terms of this License, and
You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for,
this License with every copy or phonorecord of each Derivative Work
You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly
digitally perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the
Derivative Works that alter or restrict the terms of this License or
the recipients' exercise of the rights granted hereunder, and You must
keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the
disclaimer of warranties. You may not distribute, publicly display,
publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Derivative Work
with any technological measures that control access or use of the Work
in a manner inconsistent with the terms of this License Agreement. The
above applies to the Derivative Work as incorporated in a Collective
Work, but this does not require the Collective Work apart from the
Derivative Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this
License.

     c. If you distribute, publicly display, publicly
perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work or any Derivative
Works or Collective Works, You must keep intact all copyright notices
for the Work and give the Original Author credit reasonable to the
medium or means You are utilizing by conveying the name (or pseudonym
if applicable) of the Original Author if supplied; the title of the
Work if supplied; in the case of a Derivative Work, a credit
identifying the use of the Work in the Derivative Work (e.g., ""French
translation of the Work by Original Author,"" or ""Screenplay based on
original Work by Original Author""). Such credit may be implemented in
any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a
Derivative Work or Collective Work, at a minimum such credit will
appear where any other comparable authorship credit appears and in a
manner at least as prominent as such other comparable authorship
credit.

5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer

     a. By
offering the Work for public release under this License, Licensor
represents and warrants that, to the best of Licensor's knowledge
after reasonable inquiry:

           i. Licensor has secured all
rights in the Work necessary to grant the license rights hereunder and
to permit the lawful exercise of the rights granted hereunder without
You having any obligation to pay any royalties, compulsory license
fees, residuals or any other payments;

          ii. The Work does
not infringe the copyright, trademark, publicity rights, common law
rights or any other right of any third party or constitute defamation,
invasion of privacy or other tortious injury to any third party.

    
b. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY STATED IN THIS LICENSE OR OTHERWISE AGREED IN
WRITING OR REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE WORK IS LICENSED ON AN ""AS
IS"" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED
INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES REGARDING THE CONTENTS
OR ACCURACY OF THE WORK.

6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE
EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, AND EXCEPT FOR DAMAGES ARISING FROM
LIABILITY TO A THIRD PARTY RESULTING FROM BREACH OF THE WARRANTIES IN
SECTION 5, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL
THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK,
EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES.

7. Termination

     a. This License and the rights granted
hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the
terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received
Derivative Works or Collective Works from You under this License,
however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such
individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses.
Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this
License.

     b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the
license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable
copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves
the right to release the Work under different license terms or to stop
distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such
election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license
that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this
License), and this License will continue in full force and effect
unless terminated as stated above.

8. Miscellaneous

     a. Each
time You distribute or publicly digitally perform the Work or a
Collective Work, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the
Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You
under this License.

     b. Each time You distribute or publicly
digitally perform a Derivative Work, Licensor offers to the recipient
a license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the
license granted to You under this License.

     c. If any provision
of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it
shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of
the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties
to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum
extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.

    
d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no
breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing
and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.

  
  e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties
with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings,
agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified
here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that
may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be
modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.

license. Notwithstanding the foregoing two (2) sentences, if Creative
Commons has expressly identified itself as the Licensor hereunder, it
shall have all rights and obligations of Licensor.

limited purpose of indicating to the public that the Work is licensed
under the CCPL, neither party will use the trademark ""Creative

the prior written consent of Creative Commons. Any permitted use will
be in compliance with Creative Commons' then-current trademark usage

Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work for the
purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is

limitations on the exclusive rights of the copyright owner under
copyright law or other applicable laws.

3. License Grant. Subject to
the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants You a
worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of
the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work
as stated below:

     a. to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the

     e. For the
avoidance of doubt, where the work is a musical composition:

        
 i. Performance Royalties Under Blanket Licenses. Licensor waives the
exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a performance
rights society (e.g. ASCAP, BMI, SESAC), royalties for the public
performance or public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the

     f. Webcasting Rights and

jurisdictions).

The above rights may be exercised in all media and
formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above rights
include the right to make such modifications as are technically
necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats. All
rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.

4.
Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made
subject to and limited by the following restrictions:

perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work with any technological
measures that control access or use of the Work in a manner

made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collective
Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent
practicable, remove from the Collective Work any reference to such
Licensor or the Original Author, as requested. If You create a
Derivative Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent
practicable, remove from the Derivative Work any reference to such
Licensor or the Original Author, as requested.

     b. You may
distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally
perform a Derivative Work only under the terms of this License, a
later version of this License with the same License Elements as this
License, or a Creative Commons iCommons license that contains the same
License Elements as this License (e.g. Attribution-ShareAlike 2.0
Japan). You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier
for, this License or other license specified in the previous sentence
with every copy or phonorecord of each Derivative Work You distribute,
publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform. You
may not offer or impose any terms on the Derivative Works that alter
or restrict the terms of this License or the recipients' exercise of
the rights granted hereunder, and You must keep intact all notices
that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties. You
may not distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly
digitally perform the Derivative Work with any technological measures
that control access or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with
the terms of this License Agreement. The above applies to the
Derivative Work as incorporated in a Collective Work, but this does
not require the Collective Work apart from the Derivative Work itself
to be made subject to the terms of this License.

     c. If you
distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally
perform the Work or any Derivative Works or Collective Works, You must
keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and give the Original
Author credit reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing by
conveying the name (or pseudonym if applicable) of the Original Author
if supplied; the title of the Work if supplied; to the extent
reasonably practicable, the Uniform Resource Identifier, if any, that
Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI
does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for
the Work; and in the case of a Derivative Work, a credit identifying
the use of the Work in the Derivative Work (e.g., ""French translation
of the Work by Original Author,"" or ""Screenplay based on original Work
by Original Author""). Such credit may be implemented in any reasonable
manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Derivative Work or
Collective Work, at a minimum such credit will appear where any other
comparable authorship credit appears and in a manner at least as
prominent as such other comparable authorship credit.

5.

BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO
REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE MATERIALS,
EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER
DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR
NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF
IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

6.
Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE
LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY
FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY
DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF
LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7.
Termination

     a. This License and the rights granted hereunder
will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of
this License. Individuals or entities who have received Derivative
Works or Collective Works from You under this License, however, will
not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or
entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2,
5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.

     b.
Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is
perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work).
Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the
Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at
any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to
withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is
required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this
License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as
stated above.

8. Miscellaneous

publicly digitally perform the Work or a Collective Work, the Licensor
offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and

unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity
or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and
without further action by the parties to this agreement, such
provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make
such provision valid and enforceable.

     d. No term or provision of
this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless
such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to
be charged with such waiver or consent.

     e. This License
constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to
the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or
representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor
shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any

specified in the previous sentence with every copy or phonorecord of
each Derivative Work You distribute, publicly display, publicly
perform, or publicly digitally perform. You may not offer or impose
any terms on the Derivative Works that alter or restrict the terms of
this License or the recipients' exercise of the rights granted
hereunder, and You must keep intact all notices that refer to this
License and to the disclaimer of warranties. You may not distribute,
publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the
Derivative Work with any technological measures that control access or
use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with the terms of this
License Agreement. The above applies to the Derivative Work as
incorporated in a Collective Work, but this does not require the
Collective Work apart from the Derivative Work itself to be made
subject to the terms of this License.

     c. If you distribute,
publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the
Work or any Derivative Works or Collective Works, You must keep intact
all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the
medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author
(or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or (ii) if the Original
Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g. a
sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution in
Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable
means, the name of such party or parties; the title of the Work if
supplied; to the extent reasonably practicable, the Uniform Resource
Identifier, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the
Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or
licensing information for the Work; and in the case of a Derivative
Work, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Derivative Work
(e.g., ""French translation of the Work by Original Author,"" or
""Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author""). Such credit
may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that
in the case of a Derivative Work or Collective Work, at a minimum such
credit will appear where any other comparable authorship credit
appears and in a manner at least as prominent as such other comparable
authorship credit.

5. Representations, Warranties and
Disclaimer

UNLESS OTHERWISE AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING,
LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE MATERIALS, EXPRESS, IMPLIED,
STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF
TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE,
NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY,
OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE.
SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES,
SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

6. Limitation on Liability.
EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL
LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL,
INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT
OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN
ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. Termination

     a.
This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License.
Individuals or entities who have received Derivative Works or
Collective Works from You under this License, however, will not have
their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain
in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8
will survive any termination of this License.

     b. Subject to the
above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for
the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding
the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under
different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time;
provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw
this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to
be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will
continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated
above.

8. Miscellaneous

     a. Each time You distribute or publicly
digitally perform the Work or a Collective Work, the Licensor offers
to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and
conditions as the license granted to You under this License.

     b.
Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform a Derivative
Work, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work
on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under
this License.

     c. If any provision of this License is invalid or
unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity
or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and
without further action by the parties to this agreement, such
provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make
such provision valid and enforceable.

     d. No term or provision of
this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless
such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to
be charged with such waiver or consent.

     e. This License
constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to
the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or
representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor
shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any
communication from You. This License may not be modified without the
mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.

foregoing two (2) sentences, if Creative Commons has expressly

TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE

of a literary or artistic work, or phonogram or performance and
includes cinematographic adaptations or any other form in which the
Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted including in any form
recognizably derived from the original, except that a work that
constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation for the
purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is
a musical work, performance or phonogram, the synchronization of the
Work in timed-relation with a moving image (""synching"") will be
considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this License.

""Collection"" means a collection of literary or artistic works, such as
encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances, phonograms or
broadcasts, or other works or subject matter other than works listed
in Section 1(f) below, which, by reason of the selection and
arrangement of their contents, constitute intellectual creations, in
which the Work is included in its entirety in unmodified form along
with one or more other contributions, each constituting separate and

collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collection will not be
considered an Adaptation (as defined below) for the purposes of this
License.

adaptations of works made available under that license under this
License or a Creative Commons jurisdiction license with the same
License Elements as this License.

     d. ""Distribute"" means to make
available to the public the original and copies of the Work or
Adaptation, as appropriate, through sale or other transfer of

performance the actors, singers, musicians, dancers, and other persons
who act, sing, deliver, declaim, play in, interpret or otherwise
perform literary or artistic works or expressions of folklore; (ii) in
the case of a phonogram the producer being the person or legal entity

any production in the literary, scientific and artistic domain,
whatever may be the mode or form of its expression including digital
form, such as a book, pamphlet and other writing; a lecture, address,
sermon or other work of the same nature; a dramatic or
dramatico-musical work; a choreographic work or entertainment in dumb

work of applied art; an illustration, map, plan, sketch or
three-dimensional work relative to geography, topography, architecture
or science; a performance; a broadcast; a phonogram; a compilation of
data to the extent it is protected as a copyrightable work; or a work
performed by a variety or circus performer to the extent it is not
otherwise considered a literary or artistic work.

     i. ""You"" means
an individual or entity exercising rights under this License who has
not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to the
Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to
exercise rights under this License despite a previous violation.

    
j. ""Publicly Perform"" means to perform public recitations of the Work
and to communicate to the public those public recitations, by any
means or process, including by wire or wireless means or public
digital performances; to make available to the public Works in such a
way that members of the public may access these Works from a place and
at a place individually chosen by them; to perform the Work to the
public by any means or process and the communication to the public of
the performances of the Work, including by public digital performance;
to broadcast and rebroadcast the Work by any means including signs,

Work by any means including without limitation by sound or visual

2. Fair Dealing Rights.
Nothing in this License is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any
uses free from copyright or rights arising from limitations or
exceptions that are provided for in connection with the copyright
protection under copyright law or other applicable laws.

3. License
Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor
hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual
(for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the
rights in the Work as stated below:

     a. to Reproduce the Work, to
incorporate the Work into one or more Collections, and to Reproduce
the Work as incorporated in the Collections;

     b. to create and
Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such Adaptation, including any
translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps to clearly label,
demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made to the original
Work. For example, a translation could be marked ""The original work
was translated from English to Spanish,"" or a modification could
indicate ""The original work has been modified."";

     c. to
Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated in
Collections; and,

     d. to Distribute and Publicly Perform
Adaptations.

     e. For the avoidance of doubt:

          i.
Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in
which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or
compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves
the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You
of the rights granted under this License;

          ii. Waivable
Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right
to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing
scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the exclusive right to
collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted
under this License; and,

          iii. Voluntary License Schemes.
The Licensor waives the right to collect royalties, whether
individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a member of a
collecting society that administers voluntary licensing schemes, via
that society, from any exercise by You of the rights granted under
this License.

The above rights may be exercised in all media and
formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above rights
include the right to make such modifications as are technically
necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats. Subject
to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly granted by Licensor are
hereby reserved.

4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3
above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following
restrictions:

     a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work
only under the terms of this License. You must include a copy of, or
the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every
copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer
or impose any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this
License or the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the
rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. You
may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that
refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every
copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You
Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any
effective technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability
of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to
that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a)
applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not
require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made subject
to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection, upon notice
from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the
Collection any credit as required by Section 4(c), as requested. If
You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to
the extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as
required by Section 4(c), as requested.

     b. You may Distribute or
Publicly Perform an Adaptation only under the terms of: (i) this
License; (ii) a later version of this License with the same License
Elements as this License; (iii) a Creative Commons jurisdiction
license (either this or a later license version) that contains the
same License Elements as this License (e.g., Attribution-ShareAlike
3.0 US)); (iv) a Creative Commons Compatible License. If you license
the Adaptation under one of the licenses mentioned in (iv), you must
comply with the terms of that license. If you license the Adaptation
under the terms of any of the licenses mentioned in (i), (ii) or (iii)
(the ""Applicable License""), you must comply with the terms of the
Applicable License generally and the following provisions: (I) You
must include a copy of, or the URI for, the Applicable License with
every copy of each Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform; (II)
You may not offer or impose any terms on the Adaptation that restrict
the terms of the Applicable License or the ability of the recipient of
the Adaptation to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under
the terms of the Applicable License; (III) You must keep intact all
notices that refer to the Applicable License and to the disclaimer of
warranties with every copy of the Work as included in the Adaptation
You Distribute or Publicly Perform; (IV) when You Distribute or
Publicly Perform the Adaptation, You may not impose any effective
technological measures on the Adaptation that restrict the ability of
a recipient of the Adaptation from You to exercise the rights granted
to that recipient under the terms of the Applicable License. This
Section 4(b) applies to the Adaptation as incorporated in a
Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the
Adaptation itself to be made subject to the terms of the Applicable
License.

     c. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or
any Adaptations or Collections, You must, unless a request has been
made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for
the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are
utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if
applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor
designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute,
publishing entity, journal) for attribution (""Attribution Parties"") in
Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable
means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work
if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if
any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless
such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing
information for the Work; and (iv) , consistent with Ssection 3(b), in
the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in
the Adaptation (e.g., ""French translation of the Work by Original
Author,"" or ""Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author"").
The credit required by this Section 4(c) may be implemented in any
reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation
or Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for
all contributing authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then
as part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the
credits for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of
doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section for the
purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising
Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly
assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the
Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate,
of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express prior
written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution
Parties.

     d. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the
Licensor or as may be otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You
Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or
as part of any Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort,
mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in relation to the
Work which would be prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or
reputation. Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan),
in which any exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this
License (the right to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a
distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory action
prejudicial to the Original Author's honor and reputation, the
Licensor will waive or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to
the fullest extent permitted by the applicable national law, to enable
You to reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this
License (right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise.

5.
Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer

UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY
AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS
AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE
WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER
DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR
NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF
IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

6.
Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE
LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY
FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY
DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF
LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7.
Termination

     a. This License and the rights granted hereunder
will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of
this License. Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or
Collections from You under this License, however, will not have their
licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in
full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8
will survive any termination of this License.

     b. Subject to the
above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for
the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding
the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under
different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time;
provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw
this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to
be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will
continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated
above.

8. Miscellaneous

     a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly
Perform the Work or a Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient
a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license
granted to You under this License.

     b. Each time You Distribute
or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor offers to the recipient a
license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the
license granted to You under this License.

     c. If any provision
of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it
shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of
the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties
to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum
extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.

    
d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no
breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing
and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.

  
  e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties
with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings,
agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified
here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that
may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be
modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and
You.

     f. The rights granted under, and the subject matter
referenced, in this License were drafted utilizing the terminology of
the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works
(as amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the
WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms
Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on
July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter take effect in the
relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be
enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the
implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable national
law. If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable
copyright law includes additional rights not granted under this
License, such additional rights are deemed to be included in the
License; this License is not intended to restrict the license of any
rights under applicable law. 

Creative Commons Notice

Creative

whatsoever, including without limitation any general, special,
incidental or consequential damages arising in connection to this
license. Notwithstanding the foregoing two (2) sentences, if Creative
Commons has expressly identified itself as the Licensor hereunder, it
shall have all rights and obligations of Licensor.

Except for the
limited purpose of indicating to the public that the Work is licensed
under the CCPL, Creative Commons does not authorize the use by either

form part of the License.

 Creative
Commons Corporation (“Creative Commons”) is not a law firm and
does not provide legal services or legal advice. Distribution of
Creative Commons public licenses does not create a lawyer-client or

Using Creative Commons Public
Licenses

Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of
terms and conditions that creators and other rights holders may use to
share original works of authorship and other material subject to
copyright and certain other rights specified in the public license
below. The following considerations are for informational purposes
only, are not exhaustive, and do not form part of our
licenses.

Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are
intended for use by those authorized to give the public permission to
use material in ways otherwise restricted by copyright and certain
other rights. Our licenses are irrevocable. Licensors should read and
understand the terms and conditions of the license they choose before
applying it. Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before
applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the material as
expected. Licensors should clearly mark any material not subject to
the license. This includes other CC-licensed material, or material
used under an exception or limitation to copyright. More
considerations for licensors.

Considerations for the public: By using
one of our public licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to
use the licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If the
licensor’s permission is not necessary for any reason–for example,
because of any applicable exception or limitation to copyright–then
that use is not regulated by the license. Our licenses grant only
permissions under copyright and certain other rights that a licensor
has authority to grant. Use of the licensed material may still be
restricted for other reasons, including because others have copyright
or other rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests,
such as asking that all changes be marked or described. 

Although not
required by our licenses, you are encouraged to respect those requests
where reasonable. More considerations for the public.

royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to
exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:

           
   A. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part;
and	

               B. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted
Material.
	
          2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance
of doubt, where Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this
Public License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with its
terms and conditions.
	
          3. Term. The term of this Public
License is specified in Section 6(a).
	
          4. Media and
formats; technical modifications allowed. The Licensor authorizes You
to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats whether now
known or hereafter created, and to make technical modifications
necessary to do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert
any right or authority to forbid You from making technical
modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including
technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective
Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License, simply
making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)(4) never produces
Adapted Material.
	
          5. Downstream recipients.

             
 A. Offer from the Licensor – Licensed Material. Every recipient of
the Licensed Material automatically receives an offer from the

               B. Additional
offer from the Licensor – Adapted Material. Every recipient of
Adapted Material from You automatically receives an offer from the
Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Adapted Material under
the conditions of the Adapter’s License You apply.
	
              
C. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose any
additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective
Technological Measures to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts
exercise of the Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed
Material.
	
          6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public
License constitutes or may be construed as permission to assert or
imply that You are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is,
connected with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,
the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as provided
in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).
	
     b.	Other rights.
	
          1. Moral
rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this
Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar
personality rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor
waives and/or agrees not to assert any such rights held by the
Licensor to the limited extent necessary to allow You to exercise the
Licensed Rights, but not otherwise.
	
          2. Patent and
trademark rights are not licensed under this Public License.
	
       
  3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect
royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether
directly or through a collecting society under any voluntary or
waivable statutory or compulsory licensing scheme. In all other cases
the Licensor expressly reserves any right to collect such
royalties.

     3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the

Section 4
– Sui Generis Database Rights.

Where the Licensed Rights include
Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed
Material:
	
     a.	for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants
You the right to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a
substantial portion of the contents of the database;
	
     b.	if You
include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a
database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the

individual contents) is Adapted Material, including for purposes of
Section 3(b); and
	
     c.	You must comply with the conditions in
Section 3(a) if You Share all or a substantial portion of the contents
of the database.
For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4
supplements and does not replace Your obligations under this Public
License where the Licensed Rights include other Copyright and Similar
Rights.

Section 5 – Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of
Liability.
	
     a.	Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the
Licensor, to the extent possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed

limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a
particular purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other
defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence of errors, whether or
not known or discoverable. Where disclaimers of warranties are not
allowed in full or in part, this disclaimer may not apply to You.
	
  
  b.	To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable
to You on any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence)
or otherwise for any direct, special, indirect, incidental,
consequential, punitive, exemplary, or other losses, costs, expenses,
or damages arising out of this Public License or use of the Licensed
Material, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of
such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where a limitation of
liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not
apply to You.
	
     c.	The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of
liability provided above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the
extent possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and
waiver of all liability.

Section 6 – Term and Termination.
	
    
a.	This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and
Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this
Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate
automatically.
	
     b.	Where Your right to use the Licensed Material
has terminated under Section 6(a), it reinstates:
	
          1.
automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is
cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or
	
        
 2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.
	
     c.	For the
avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the
Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public
License.

offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop
distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will

agreements regarding the Licensed Material not stated herein are

Public License.

avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not be
interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any
use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without
permission under this Public License.
	
     b.	To the extent
possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed
unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum
extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be
reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License without
affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions.
	

    c.	No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and
no failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the
Licensor.
	
     d.	Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may

immunities that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal
processes of any jurisdiction or authority.

 CREATIVE COMMONS CORPORATION IS
NOT A LAW FIRM AND DOES NOT PROVIDE LEGAL SERVICES. DISTRIBUTION OF
THIS DOCUMENT DOES NOT CREATE AN ATTORNEY-CLIENT RELATIONSHIP.
CREATIVE COMMONS PROVIDES THIS INFORMATION ON AN ""AS-IS"" BASIS.
CREATIVE COMMONS MAKES NO WARRANTIES REGARDING THE USE OF THIS
DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS PROVIDED HEREUNDER, AND DISCLAIMS
LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE
INFORMATION OR WORKS PROVIDED HEREUNDER.  

Statement of Purpose

The
laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the
creator and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an ""owner"") of an
original work of authorship and/or a database (each, a
""Work"").

Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights
to a Work for the purpose of contributing to a commons of creative,
cultural and scientific works (""Commons"") that the public can reliably
and without fear of later claims of infringement build upon, modify,
incorporate in other works, reuse and redistribute as freely as
possible in any form whatsoever and for any purposes, including
without limitation commercial purposes. These owners may contribute to
the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further
production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain
reputation or greater distribution for their Work in part through the
use and efforts of others.

For these and/or other purposes and
motivations, and without any expectation of additional consideration
or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a Work (the
""Affirmer""), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright and
Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the
Work and publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge
of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning
and intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights.

1. Copyright and
Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be protected by
copyright and related or neighboring rights (""Copyright and Related
Rights""). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited
to, the following:

     i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute,
perform, display, communicate, and translate a Work;

     ii. moral
rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);

    
iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or
likeness depicted in a Work;

     iv. rights protecting against
unfair competition in regards to a Work, subject to the limitations in
paragraph 4(a), below;

     v. rights protecting the extraction,
dissemination, use and reuse of data in a Work;

     vi. database
rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the European
Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection
of databases, and under any national implementation thereof, including
any amended or successor version of such directive); and

     vii.
other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world
based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations
thereof.

2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in
contravention of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully,
permanently, irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and
surrenders all of Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and
associated claims and causes of action, whether now known or unknown
(including existing as well as future claims and causes of action), in
the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum
duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time
extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number
of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without
limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the
""Waiver""). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of
the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and
successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be subject to
revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other legal
or equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the
public as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.

3.
Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason
be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then
the Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking
into account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to
the extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each
affected person a royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable,
non exclusive, irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise
Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work (i) in all
territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by
applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in
any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv)
for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial,
advertising or promotional purposes (the ""License""). The License shall
be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the
Work. Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally
invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity
or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License,
and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i)
exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in
the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of action
with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's
express Statement of Purpose.

4. Limitations and Disclaimers.

    
a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived,
abandoned, surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this
document.

     b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no
representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Work,
express, implied, statutory or otherwise, including without limitation
warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular
purpose, non infringement, or the absence of latent or other defects,
accuracy, or the present or absence of errors, whether or not
discoverable, all to the greatest extent permissible under applicable
law.

     c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of
other persons that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including
without limitation any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the
Work. Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any
necessary consents, permissions or other rights required for any use
of the Work.

     d. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that
Creative Commons is not a party to this document and has no duty or
obligation with respect to this CC0 or use of the Work.

3.4.
Application of Additional Terms.
You may not offer or impose any terms
on any Covered Software in Source Code form that alters or restricts
the applicable version of this License or the recipients’ rights
hereunder. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty,
support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients
of Covered Software. However, you may do so only on Your own behalf,

form under a different license, You must make it absolutely clear that
any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not

Except as provided in Section 4.3, no one other than the license
steward has the right to modify this License.

4.2. Effect of New
Versions.
You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make
the Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the
License under which You originally received the Covered Software. If
the Initial Developer includes a notice in the Original Software
prohibiting it from being distributed or otherwise made available
under any subsequent version of the License, You must distribute and
make the Covered Software available under the terms of the version of
the License under which You originally received the Covered Software.
Otherwise, You may also choose to use, distribute or otherwise make
the Covered Software available under the terms of any subsequent
version of the License published by the license steward.

4.3.
Modified Versions.
When You are an Initial Developer and You want to
create a new license for Your Original Software, You may create and
use a modified version of this License if You: (a) rename the license

to note that the license differs from this License); and (b) otherwise
make it clear that the license contains terms which differ from this
License.

3.4.
Application of Additional Terms.
You may not offer or impose any terms
on any Covered Software in Source Code form that alters or restricts
the applicable version of this License or the recipients' rights
hereunder. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty,
support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients
of Covered Software. However, you may do so only on Your own behalf,
and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You
must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support,
indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You
hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor
for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such
Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability
terms You offer.

right to modify this License.

4.2. Effect of New Versions.
You may
always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered
Software available under the terms of the version of the License under
which You originally received the Covered Software. If the Initial
Developer includes a notice in the Original Software prohibiting it
from being distributed or otherwise made available under any
subsequent version of the License, You must distribute and make the
Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the
License under which You originally received the Covered Software.
Otherwise, You may also choose to use, distribute or otherwise make
the Covered Software available under the terms of any subsequent
version of the License published by the license steward.

4.3.
Modified Versions.
When You are an Initial Developer and You want to
create a new license for Your Original Software, You may create and

propriété intellectuelle et de la protection qu’il offre aux
auteurs et titulaires des droits patrimoniaux sur un
logiciel.
	•	d’autre part, le respect des principes de diffusion
des logiciels libres: accès au code source, droits étendus
conférés aux utilisateurs.

Les auteurs de la licence CeCILL1
sont:

Commissariat à l’Energie Atomique – CEA, établissement
public de caractère scientifique technique et industriel, dont le
siège est situé 31-33 rue de la Fédération, 75752 PARIS cedex

PREAMBULE

Ce contrat
est une licence de logiciel libre dont l'objectif est de conférer aux
utilisateurs la liberté de modification et de redistribution du
logiciel régi par cette licence dans le cadre d'un modèle de
diffusion «open source».

L'exercice de ces libertés est assorti de
certains devoirs à la charge des utilisateurs afin de préserver ce
statut au cours des redistributions ultérieures.

L’accessibilité
au code source et les droits de copie, de modification et de
redistribution qui en découlent ont pour contrepartie de n’offrir
aux utilisateurs qu’une garantie limitée et de ne faire peser sur
l’auteur du logiciel, le titulaire des droits patrimoniaux et les
concédants successifs qu’une responsabilité restreinte.

A cet
égard l’attention de l’utilisateur est attirée sur les risques
associés au chargement, à l’utilisation, à la modification et/ou
au développement et à la reproduction du logiciel par
l’utilisateur étant donné sa spécificité de logiciel libre, qui
peut le rendre complexe à manipuler et qui le réserve donc à des
développeurs et des professionnels avertis possédant des
connaissances informatiques approfondies. Les utilisateurs sont donc
invités à charger et tester l’adéquation du Logiciel à leurs
besoins dans des conditions permettant d'assurer la sécurité de
leurs systèmes et ou de leurs données et, plus généralement, à
l'utiliser et l'exploiter dans les même conditions de sécurité. Ce
contrat peut être reproduit et diffusé librement, sous réserve de
le conserver en l’état, sans ajout ni suppression de clauses.

Ce
contrat est susceptible de s’appliquer à tout logiciel dont le
titulaire des droits patrimoniaux décide de soumettre
l’exploitation aux dispositions qu’il contient.

PREAMBLE

The purpose of this Free Software Licensing Agreement is
to grant users the right to modify and redistribute the software
governed by this license within the framework of an ""open source""
distribution model.

The exercising of these rights is conditional
upon certain obligations for users so as to ensure that this status is
retained for subsequent redistribution operations.

As a counterpart
to the access to the source code and rights to copy, modify and
redistribute granted by the license, users are provided only with a
limited warranty and the software's author, the holder of the economic
rights, and the successive licensors only have limited liability.

In
this respect, it is brought to the user's attention that the risks
associated with loading, using, modifying and/or developing or
reproducing the software by the user given its nature of Free
Software, that may mean that it is complicated to manipulate, and that
also therefore means that it is reserved for developers and
experienced professionals having in-depth computer knowledge. Users
are therefore encouraged to load and test the Software's suitability
as regards their requirements in conditions enabling the security of
their systems and/or data to be ensured and, more generally, to use
and operate it in the same conditions of security. This Agreement may
be freely reproduced and published, provided it is not altered, and
that no Articles are either added or removed herefrom.

Avertissement

Ce contrat
est une licence de logiciel libre issue d'une concertation entre ses
auteurs afin que le respect de deux grands principes préside à sa
rédaction:

d'une part, le respect des principes de diffusion des
logiciels libres: accès au code source, droits étendus conférés
aux utilisateurs,
d'autre part, la désignation d'un droit applicable,
le droit français, auquel elle est conforme, tant au regard du droit
de la responsabilité civile que du droit de la propriété
intellectuelle et de la protection qu'il offre aux auteurs et
titulaires des droits patrimoniaux sur un logiciel.
Les auteurs de la
licence CeCILL1 sont:

Commissariat à l'Energie Atomique - CEA,
établissement public de recherche à caractère scientifique,
technique et industriel, dont le siège est situé 25 rue Leblanc,
immeuble Le Ponant D, 75015 Paris.

Centre National de la Recherche
Scientifique - CNRS, établissement public à caractère scientifique
et technologique, dont le siège est situé 3 rue Michel-Ange, 75794
Paris cedex 16.

Préambule

Ce contrat
est une licence de logiciel libre dont l'objectif est de conférer aux
utilisateurs la liberté de modification et de redistribution du
logiciel régi par cette licence dans le cadre d'un modèle de
diffusion en logiciel libre.

L'exercice de ces libertés est assorti
de certains devoirs à la charge des utilisateurs afin de préserver
ce statut au cours des redistributions ultérieures.

L'accessibilité
au code source et les droits de copie, de modification et de
redistribution qui en découlent ont pour contrepartie de n'offrir aux
utilisateurs qu'une garantie limitée et de ne faire peser sur
l'auteur du logiciel, le titulaire des droits patrimoniaux et les
concédants successifs qu'une responsabilité restreinte.

A cet
égard l'attention de l'utilisateur est attirée sur les risques
associés au chargement, à l'utilisation, à la modification et/ou au
développement et à la reproduction du logiciel par l'utilisateur
étant donné sa spécificité de logiciel libre, qui peut le rendre
complexe à manipuler et qui le réserve donc à des développeurs ou
des professionnels avertis possédant des connaissances informatiques
approfondies. Les utilisateurs sont donc invités à charger et tester
l'adéquation du logiciel à leurs besoins dans des conditions
permettant d'assurer la sécurité de leurs systèmes et/ou de leurs
données et, plus généralement, à l'utiliser et l'exploiter dans
les mêmes conditions de sécurité. Ce contrat peut être reproduit
et diffusé librement, sous réserve de le conserver en l'état, sans
ajout ni suppression de clauses.

Ce contrat est susceptible de
s'appliquer à tout logiciel dont le titulaire des droits patrimoniaux
décide de soumettre l'exploitation aux dispositions qu'il
contient.

ce point sur les risques associés au chargement, à l'utilisation, la
modification et/ou au développement et à la reproduction du Logiciel
qui sont réservés à des utilisateurs avertis.

Il relève de la
responsabilité du Licencié de contrôler, par tous moyens,
l'adéquation du produit à ses besoins, son bon fonctionnement et de
s'assurer qu'il ne causera pas de dommages aux personnes et aux
biens.

9.2 Le Concédant déclare de bonne foi être en droit de
concéder l'ensemble des droits attachés au Logiciel (comprenant
notamment les droits visés à l'article 5).

9.3 Le Licencié
reconnaît que le Logiciel est fourni ""en l'état"" par le Concédant
sans autre garantie, expresse ou tacite, que celle prévue à
l'article 9.2 et notamment sans aucune garantie sur sa valeur
commerciale, son caractère sécurisé, innovant ou pertinent.

En
particulier, le Concédant ne garantit pas que le Logiciel est exempt
d'erreur, qu'il fonctionnera sans interruption, qu'il sera compatible
avec l'équipement du Licencié et sa configuration logicielle ni
qu'il remplira les besoins du Licencié.

9.4 Le Concédant ne
garantit pas, de manière expresse ou tacite, que le Logiciel ne porte
pas atteinte à un quelconque droit de propriété intellectuelle d'un
tiers portant sur un brevet, un logiciel ou sur tout autre droit de
propriété. Ainsi, le Concédant exclut toute garantie au profit du
Licencié contre les actions en contrefaçon qui pourraient être
diligentées au titre de l'utilisation, de la modification, et de la
redistribution du Logiciel. Néanmoins, si de telles actions sont
exercées contre le Licencié, le Concédant lui apportera son aide
technique et juridique pour sa défense. Cette aide technique et
juridique est déterminée au cas par cas entre le Concédant
concerné et le Licencié dans le cadre d'un protocole d'accord. Le
Concédant dégage toute responsabilité quant à l'utilisation de la
dénomination du Logiciel par le Licencié. Aucune garantie n'est
apportée quant à l'existence de droits antérieurs sur le nom du
Logiciel et sur l'existence d'une marque.

Article 10 -
RESILIATION

Concédant est libre de proposer, sous sa seule responsabilité, à
ses licenciés une garantie, qui n'engagera que lui, lors de la
redistribution du Logiciel et/ou du Logiciel Modifié et ce, dans les
conditions qu'il souhaite. Cette garantie et les modalités
financières de son application feront l'objet d'un acte séparé
entre le Concédant et le Licencié. 

 Article 8 -
RESPONSABILITE

8.1 Sous réserve des dispositions de l'article 8.2
<#limite-responsabilite>, le Licencié a la faculté, sous réserve de
prouver la faute du Concédant concerné, de solliciter la réparation
du préjudice direct qu'il subirait du fait du Logiciel et dont il
apportera la preuve.

8.2 La responsabilité du Concédant est
limitée aux engagements pris en application du Contrat et ne saurait
être engagée en raison notamment: (i) des dommages dus à
l'inexécution, totale ou partielle, de ses obligations par le
Licencié, (ii) des dommages directs ou indirects découlant de
l'utilisation ou des performances du Logiciel subis par le Licencié
et (iii) plus généralement d'un quelconque dommage indirect. En
particulier, les Parties conviennent expressément que tout préjudice
financier ou commercial (par exemple perte de données, perte de
bénéfices, perte d'exploitation, perte de clientèle ou de
commandes, manque à gagner, trouble commercial quelconque) ou toute
action dirigée contre le Licencié par un tiers, constitue un dommage
indirect et n'ouvre pas droit à réparation par le Concédant. 


Article 9 - GARANTIE

9.1 Le Licencié reconnaît que l'état actuel
des connaissances scientifiques et techniques au moment de la mise en
circulation du Logiciel ne permet pas d'en tester et d'en vérifier
toutes les utilisations ni de détecter l'existence d'éventuels
défauts. L'attention du Licencié a été attirée sur ce point sur
les risques associés au chargement, à l'utilisation, la modification
et/ou au développement et à la reproduction du Logiciel qui sont
réservés à des utilisateurs avertis.

Il relève de la
responsabilité du Licencié de contrôler, par tous moyens,
l'adéquation du produit à ses besoins, son bon fonctionnement et de
s'assurer qu'il ne causera pas de dommages aux personnes et aux
biens.

9.2 Le Concédant déclare de bonne foi être en droit de
concéder l'ensemble des droits attachés au Logiciel (comprenant
notamment les droits visés à l'article 5 <#etendue>).

9.3 Le
Licencié reconnaît que le Logiciel est fourni ""en l'état"" par le
Concédant sans autre garantie, expresse ou tacite, que celle prévue
à l'article 9.2 <#bonne-foi> et notamment sans aucune garantie sur sa
valeur commerciale, son caractère sécurisé, innovant ou
pertinent.

En particulier, le Concédant ne garantit pas que le
Logiciel est exempt d'erreur, qu'il fonctionnera sans interruption,
qu'il sera compatible avec l'équipement du Licencié et sa
configuration logicielle ni qu'il remplira les besoins du
Licencié.

9.4 Le Concédant ne garantit pas, de manière expresse ou
tacite, que le Logiciel ne porte pas atteinte à un quelconque droit
de propriété intellectuelle d'un tiers portant sur un brevet, un
logiciel ou sur tout autre droit de propriété. Ainsi, le Concédant
exclut toute garantie au profit du Licencié contre les actions en
contrefaçon qui pourraient être diligentées au titre de
l'utilisation, de la modification, et de la redistribution du
Logiciel. Néanmoins, si de telles actions sont exercées contre le
Licencié, le Concédant lui apportera son expertise technique et
juridique pour sa défense. Cette expertise technique et juridique est
déterminée au cas par cas entre le Concédant concerné et le
Licencié dans le cadre d'un protocole d'accord. Le Concédant dégage
toute responsabilité quant à l'utilisation de la dénomination du
Logiciel par le Licencié. Aucune garantie n'est apportée quant à
l'existence de droits antérieurs sur le nom du Logiciel et sur
l'existence d'une marque.

Avertissement

Ce contrat est une licence de logiciel libre issue
d'une concertation entre ses auteurs afin que le respect de deux
grands principes préside à sa rédaction:

     * d'une part, le
respect des principes de diffusion des logiciels libres: accès au
code source, droits étendus conférés aux utilisateurs, 

     *
d'autre part, la désignation d'un droit applicable, le droit
français, auquel elle est conforme, tant au regard du droit de la
responsabilité civile que du droit de la propriété intellectuelle
et de la protection qu'il offre aux auteurs et titulaires des droits
patrimoniaux sur un logiciel.

 Préambule

Ce
contrat est une licence de logiciel libre dont l'objectif est de
conférer aux utilisateurs la liberté de modification et de
redistribution du logiciel régi par cette licence dans le cadre d'un
modèle de diffusion en logiciel libre.

L'exercice de ces libertés
est assorti de certains devoirs à la charge des utilisateurs afin de
préserver ce statut au cours des redistributions
ultérieures.

L'accessibilité au code source et les droits de copie,
de modification et de redistribution qui en découlent ont pour
contrepartie de n'offrir aux utilisateurs qu'une garantie limitée et
de ne faire peser sur l'auteur du logiciel, le titulaire des droits
patrimoniaux et les concédants successifs qu'une responsabilité
restreinte.

A cet égard l'attention de l'utilisateur est attirée
sur les risques associés au chargement, à l'utilisation, à la
modification et/ou au développement et à la reproduction du logiciel
par l'utilisateur étant donné sa spécificité de logiciel libre,
qui peut le rendre complexe à manipuler et qui le réserve donc à
des développeurs ou des professionnels avertis possédant des
connaissances informatiques approfondies. Les utilisateurs sont donc
invités à charger et tester l'adéquation du logiciel à leurs
besoins dans des conditions permettant d'assurer la sécurité de
leurs systèmes et/ou de leurs données et, plus généralement, à
l'utiliser et l'exploiter dans les mêmes conditions de sécurité. Ce
contrat peut être reproduit et diffusé librement, sous réserve de
le conserver en l'état, sans ajout ni suppression de clauses.

Ce
contrat est susceptible de s'appliquer à tout logiciel dont le
titulaire des droits patrimoniaux décide de soumettre l'exploitation
aux dispositions qu'il contient.

Préambule

Ce contrat
est une licence de logiciel libre dont l'objectif est de conférer aux
utilisateurs une très large liberté de modification et de
redistribution du logiciel régi par cette licence.

L'exercice de
cette liberté est assorti d'une obligation forte de citation à la
charge de ceux qui distribueraient un logiciel incorporant un logiciel
régi par la présente licence afin d'assurer que les contributions de
tous soient correctement identifiées et reconnues.

L'accessibilité
au code source et les droits de copie, de modification et de
redistribution qui découlent de ce contrat ont pour contrepartie de
n'offrir aux utilisateurs qu'une garantie limitée et de ne faire
peser sur l'auteur du logiciel, le titulaire des droits patrimoniaux
et les concédants successifs qu'une responsabilité restreinte.

A
cet égard l'attention de l'utilisateur est attirée sur les risques
associés au chargement, à l'utilisation, à la modification et/ou au
développement et à la reproduction du logiciel par l'utilisateur
étant donné sa spécificité de logiciel libre, qui peut le rendre
complexe à manipuler et qui le réserve donc à des développeurs ou
des professionnels avertis possédant des connaissances informatiques
approfondies. Les utilisateurs sont donc invités à charger et tester
l'adéquation du logiciel à leurs besoins dans des conditions
permettant d'assurer la sécurité de leurs systèmes et/ou de leurs
données et, plus généralement, à l'utiliser et l'exploiter dans
les mêmes conditions de sécurité. Ce contrat peut être reproduit
et diffusé librement, sous réserve de le conserver en l'état, sans
ajout ni suppression de clauses.

Ce contrat est susceptible de
s'appliquer à tout logiciel dont le titulaire des droits patrimoniaux
décide de soumettre l'exploitation aux dispositions qu'il
contient.

l'état actuel des connaissances scientifiques et techniques au moment
de la mise en circulation du Logiciel ne permet pas d'en tester et
d'en vérifier toutes les utilisations ni de détecter l'existence
d'éventuels défauts. L'attention du Licencié a été attirée sur
ce point sur les risques associés au chargement, à l'utilisation, la
modification et/ou au développement et à la reproduction du Logiciel
qui sont réservés à des utilisateurs avertis.

Il relève de la
responsabilité du Licencié de contrôler, par tous moyens,
l'adéquation du produit à ses besoins, son bon fonctionnement et de
s'assurer qu'il ne causera pas de dommages aux personnes et aux
biens.

9.2 Le Concédant déclare de bonne foi être en droit de
concéder l'ensemble des droits attachés au Logiciel (comprenant
notamment les droits visés à l'article 5).

9.3 Le Licencié
reconnaît que le Logiciel est fourni ""en l'état"" par le Concédant
sans autre garantie, expresse ou tacite, que celle prévue à
l'article 9.2 et notamment sans aucune garantie sur sa valeur
commerciale, son caractère sécurisé, innovant ou pertinent.

En
particulier, le Concédant ne garantit pas que le Logiciel est exempt
d'erreur, qu'il fonctionnera sans interruption, qu'il sera compatible
avec l'équipement du Licencié et sa configuration logicielle ni
qu'il remplira les besoins du Licencié.

9.4 Le Concédant ne
garantit pas, de manière expresse ou tacite, que le Logiciel ne porte
pas atteinte à un quelconque droit de propriété intellectuelle d'un
tiers portant sur un brevet, un logiciel ou sur tout autre droit de
propriété. Ainsi, le Concédant exclut toute garantie au profit du
Licencié contre les actions en contrefaçon qui pourraient être
diligentées au titre de l'utilisation, de la modification, et de la
redistribution du Logiciel. Néanmoins, si de telles actions sont
exercées contre le Licencié, le Concédant lui apportera son aide
technique et juridique pour sa défense. Cette aide technique et
juridique est déterminée au cas par cas entre le Concédant
concerné et le Licencié dans le cadre d'un protocole d'accord. Le
Concédant dégage toute responsabilité quant à l'utilisation de la
dénomination du Logiciel par le Licencié. Aucune garantie n'est
apportée quant à l'existence de droits antérieurs sur le nom du
Logiciel et sur l'existence d'une marque.

Article 10 -
RESILIATION

10.1 En cas de manquement par le Licencié aux
obligations mises à sa charge par le Contrat, le Concédant pourra
résilier de plein droit le Contrat trente (30) jours après
notification adressée au Licencié et restée sans effet.

10.2 Le
Licencié dont le Contrat est résilié n'est plus autorisé à

THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS
PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS COMMON PUBLIC LICENSE (""AGREEMENT"").
ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES
RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.

1.
DEFINITIONS

""Contribution"" means:

     a) in the case of the initial
Contributor, the initial code and documentation distributed under this
Agreement, and

     b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:

 
        i) changes to the Program, and

          ii) additions to the
Program;

where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate
from and are distributed by that particular Contributor. A
Contribution 'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to the
Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such
Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the
Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in
conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and
(ii) are not derivative works of the Program.

""Contributor"" means any
person or entity that distributes the Program.

""Licensed Patents ""
mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are necessarily
infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when
combined with the Program.

""Program"" means the Contributions
distributed in accordance with this Agreement.

""Recipient"" means
anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, including all
Contributors.

2. GRANT OF RIGHTS

     a) Subject to the terms of
this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a
non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce,
prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform,
distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if
any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form.


    b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent
license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,
import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if
any, in source code and object code form. This patent license shall
apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at
the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition
of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the
Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other
combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is
licensed hereunder.

     c) Recipient understands that although each
Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein,
no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does
not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any
other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient
for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of
intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to
exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient
hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual
property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent
license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it
is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before
distributing the Program.

     d) Each Contributor represents that to
its knowledge it has sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution,
if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in this
Agreement.

3. REQUIREMENTS

A Contributor may choose to distribute
the Program in object code form under its own license agreement,
provided that:

     a) it complies with the terms and conditions of
this Agreement; and

     b) its license agreement:

          i)
effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and
conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of
title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of
merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;

          ii)
effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for
damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and
consequential damages, such as lost profits;

          iii) states
that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by
that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and

          iv)
states that source code for the Program is available from such
Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable
manner on or through a medium customarily used for software
exchange.

When the Program is made available in source code form:

  
  a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and

     b) a
copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the
Program.

Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices
contained within the Program.

Each Contributor must identify itself
as the originator of its Contribution, if any, in a manner that
reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of
the Contribution.

4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION

Commercial distributors
of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end
users, business partners and the like. While this license is intended
to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who
includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in
a manner which does not create potential liability for other
Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a
commercial product offering, such Contributor (""Commercial
Contributor"") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other
Contributor (""Indemnified Contributor"") against any losses, damages
and costs (collectively ""Losses"") arising from claims, lawsuits and
other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified
Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such
Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the
Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this
section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or
alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an
Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial
Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial
Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor
in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The
Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own
expense.

For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a
commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a
Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes
performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those
performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's
responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor
would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to
those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any
other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial
Contributor must pay those damages.

5. NO WARRANTY

EXCEPT AS
EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN
""AS IS"" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR
CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR
A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for
determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program
and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under
this Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and costs of
program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of
data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of
operations.

6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH
IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE
ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,
EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST
PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN
CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR
OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE
PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF
ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. GENERAL

If any
provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further
action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the
minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and
enforceable.

If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a
Contributor with respect to a patent applicable to software (including
a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit), then any patent licenses
granted by that Contributor to such Recipient under this Agreement
shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. In addition,
if Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other
software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such
Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of
the date such litigation is filed.

All Recipient's rights under this
Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the
material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such
failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such
noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement
terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the
Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's
obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient
relating to the Program shall continue and survive.

Everyone is
permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in
order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only
be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves
the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this
Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward
has the right to modify this Agreement. IBM is the initial Agreement
Steward. IBM may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement
Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the
Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program
(including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the
version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition,
after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may
elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under
the new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b)
above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual
property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly,
by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not
expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.

This Agreement
is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the intellectual
property laws of the United States of America. No party to this
Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one
year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to
a jury trial in any resulting litigation.

Preamble

The intent of this document
is to state the conditions under which a Package may be copied, such
that the Copyright Holder maintains some semblance of artistic control
over the development of the package, while giving the users of the
package the right to use and distribute the Package in a more-or-less
customary fashion, plus the right to make reasonable
modifications.

Definitions:

 ""Package"" refers to the collection of
files distributed by the Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that
collection of files created through textual modification.

 ""Standard
Version"" refers to such a Package if it has not been modified, or has
been modified in accordance with the wishes of the Copyright Holder as
specified below.

 ""Copyright Holder"" is whoever is named in the
copyright or copyrights for the package.

 ""You"" is you, if you're
thinking about copying or distributing this Package.

 ""Distribution
fee"" is a fee you charge for providing a copy of this Package to
another party.

 ""Freely Available"" means that no fee is charged for
the right to use the item, though there may be fees involved in
handling the item. It also means that recipients of the item may
redistribute it under the same conditions they received it.

1. You
may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the
Standard Version of this Package without restriction, provided that
you duplicate all of the original copyright notices and associated
disclaimers.

2. You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other
modifications derived from the Public Domain, or those made Freely
Available, or from the Copyright Holder. A Package modified in such a
way shall still be considered the Standard Version.

3. You may
otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way, provided that
you insert a prominent notice in each changed file stating how and
when you changed that file, and provided that you do at least ONE of
the following:

     a) place your modifications in the Public Domain
or otherwise make them Freely Available, such as by posting said
modifications to Usenet or an equivalent medium, or placing the
modifications on a major network archive site allowing unrestricted
access to them, or by allowing the Copyright Holder to include your
modifications in the Standard Version of the Package.

     b) use the
modified Package only within your corporation or organization.

    
c) rename any non-standard executables so the names do not conflict
with standard executables, which must also be provided, and provide a
separate manual page for each non-standard executable that clearly
documents how it differs from the Standard Version.

     d) make
other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.

     e)
permit and encourge anyone who receives a copy of the modified Package
permission to make your modifications Freely Available in some
specific way. 

4. You may distribute the programs of this Package in
object code or executable form, provided that you do at least ONE of
the following:

     a) distribute a Standard Version of the
executables and library files, together with instructions (in the
manual page or equivalent) on where to get the Standard Version.

    
b) accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of the
Package with your modifications.

     c) give non-standard
executables non-standard names, and clearly document the differences
in manual pages (or equivalent), together with instructions on where
to get the Standard Version.

     d) make other distribution
arrangements with the Copyright Holder.

     e) offer the
machine-readable source of the Package, with your modifications, by
mail order.

5. You may charge a distribution fee for any distribution
of this Package. If you offer support for this Package, you may charge
any fee you choose for that support. You may not charge a license fee
for the right to use this Package itself. You may distribute this
Package in aggregate with other (possibly commercial and possibly
nonfree) programs as part of a larger (possibly commercial and
possibly nonfree) software distribution, and charge license fees for
other parts of that software distribution, provided that you do not
advertise this Package as a product of your own. If the Package
includes an interpreter, You may embed this Package's interpreter
within an executable of yours (by linking); this shall be construed as
a mere form of aggregation, provided that the complete Standard
Version of the interpreter is so embedded.

6. The scripts and library
files supplied as input to or produced as output from the programs of
this Package do not automatically fall under the copyright of this
Package, but belong to whoever generated them, and may be sold
commercially, and may be aggregated with this Package. If such scripts
or library files are aggregated with this Package via the so-called
""undump"" or ""unexec"" methods of producing a binary executable image,
then distribution of such an image shall neither be construed as a
distribution of this Package nor shall it fall under the restrictions
of Paragraphs 3 and 4, provided that you do not represent such an
executable image as a Standard Version of this Package.

7. C
subroutines (or comparably compiled subroutines in other languages)
supplied by you and linked into this Package in order to emulate
subroutines and variables of the language defined by this Package
shall not be considered part of this Package, but are the equivalent
of input as in Paragraph 6, provided these subroutines do not change
the language in any way that would cause it to fail the regression
tests for the language.

8. Aggregation of the Standard Version of the
Package with a commercial distribution is always permitted provided
that the use of this Package is embedded; that is, when no overt
attempt is made to make this Package's interfaces visible to the end
user of the commercial distribution. Such use shall not be construed
as a distribution of this Package.

9. The name of the Copyright
Holder may not be used to endorse or promote products derived from
this software without specific prior written permission.

10. THIS
PACKAGE IS PROVIDED ""AS IS"" AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED
WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTIBILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

freely available software, you are free to use, modify, copy, and
distribute--perpetually and irrevocably--the DOC software source code
and object code produced from the source, as well as copy and
distribute modified versions of this software. You must, however,
include this copyright statement along with any code built using DOC
software that you release. No copyright statement needs to be provided
if you just ship binary executables of your software products.

You
can use DOC software in commercial and/or binary software releases and
are under no obligation to redistribute any of your source code that
is built using DOC software. Note, however, that you may not
misappropriate the DOC software code, such as copyrighting it yourself
or claiming authorship of the DOC software code, in a way that will
prevent DOC software from being distributed freely using an
open-source development model. You needn't inform anyone that you're
using DOC software in your software, though we encourage you to let us
know so we can promote your project in the DOC software success
stories.

The ACE, TAO, CIAO, DAnCE, and CoSMIC web sites are

Systems (ISIS) and the Center for Distributed Object Computing of

are provided by the submitter ``as is'' with no warranties whatsoever,
including any warranty of merchantability, noninfringement of third
party intellectual property, or fitness for any particular purpose. In
no event shall the submitter be liable for any direct, indirect,
special, exemplary, punitive, or consequential damages, including
without limitation, lost profits, even if advised of the possibility
of such damages. Likewise, DOC software is provided as is with no
warranties of any kind, including the warranties of design,
merchantability, and fitness for a particular purpose,
noninfringement, or arising from a course of dealing, usage or trade
practice. Washington University, UC Irvine, Vanderbilt University,
their employees, and students shall have no liability with respect to
the infringement of copyrights, trade secrets or any patents by DOC
software or any part thereof. Moreover, in no event will Washington

DOC software is provided with no
support and without any obligation on the part of Washington

support for DOC software, however. DOC software is Y2K-compliant, as
long as the underlying OS platform is Y2K-compliant. Likewise, DOC
software is compliant with the new US daylight savings rule passed by
Congress as ""The Energy Policy Act of 2005,"" which established new
daylight savings times (DST) rules for the United States that expand
DST as of March 2007. Since DOC software obtains time/date and
calendaring information from operating systems users will not be
affected by the new DST rules as long as they upgrade their operating
systems accordingly.

THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED
UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE PUBLIC LICENSE (""AGREEMENT""). ANY USE,
REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S
ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.

1. DEFINITIONS

""Contribution"" means:
 
   a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and
documentation distributed under this Agreement, and
     b) in the
case of each subsequent Contributor:
          i) changes to the
Program, and
          ii) additions to the Program;

where such
changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are
distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution
'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such
Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf.
Contributions do not include additions to the Program which: (i) are
separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with the
Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative
works of the Program.
""Contributor"" means any person or entity that
distributes the Program.

""Licensed Patents"" mean patent claims
licensable by a Contributor which are necessarily infringed by the use
or sale of its Contribution alone or when combined with the
Program.

""Program"" means the Contributions distributed in accordance
with this Agreement.

""Recipient"" means anyone who receives the
Program under this Agreement, including all Contributors.

2. GRANT OF
RIGHTS

     a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each
Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide,
royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works
of, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the
Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative works,
in source code and object code form.
 
     b) Subject to the terms of
this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a
non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed
Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise
transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code
and object code form. This patent license shall apply to the
combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the
Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the
Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed
Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations
which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed
hereunder.

     c) Recipient understands that although each
Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein,
no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does
not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any
other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient
for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of
intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to
exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient
hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual
property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent
license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it
is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before
distributing the Program.

     d) Each Contributor represents that to
its knowledge it has sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution,
if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in this
Agreement.

3. REQUIREMENTS
A Contributor may choose to distribute the
Program in object code form under its own license agreement, provided
that:

     a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this
Agreement; and
 
     b) its license agreement:
          i)
effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and
conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of
title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of
merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;
          ii)
effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for
damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and
consequential damages, such as lost profits;
          iii) states
that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by
that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and
          iv)
states that source code for the Program is available from such
Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable
manner on or through a medium customarily used for software
exchange.

When the Program is made available in source code form:

  
  a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and

     b) a
copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the
Program.
Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices
contained within the Program.

Each Contributor must identify itself
as the originator of its Contribution, if any, in a manner that
reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of
the Contribution.

4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
Commercial distributors
of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end
users, business partners and the like. While this license is intended
to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who
includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in
a manner which does not create potential liability for other
Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a
commercial product offering, such Contributor (""Commercial
Contributor"") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other
Contributor (""Indemnified Contributor"") against any losses, damages
and costs (collectively ""Losses"") arising from claims, lawsuits and
other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified
Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such
Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the
Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this
section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or
alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an
Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial
Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial
Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor
in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The
Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own
expense.

For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a
commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a
Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes
performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those
performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's
responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor
would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to
those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any
other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial
Contributor must pay those damages.

5. NO WARRANTY
EXCEPT AS
EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN
""AS IS"" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR
CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR
A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for
determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program
and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under
this Agreement , including but not limited to the risks and costs of
program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of
data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of
operations.

6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH
IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE
ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,
EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST
PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN
CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR
OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE
PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF
ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. GENERAL

If any
provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further
action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the
minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and
enforceable.

If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any
entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging
that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with
other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then
such Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as
of the date such litigation is filed.

All Recipient's rights under
this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the
material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such
failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such
noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement
terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the
Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's
obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient
relating to the Program shall continue and survive.

Everyone is
permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in
order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only
be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves
the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this
Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward
has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the
initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the
responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable
separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a
distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions)
may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement
under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the
Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the
Program (including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as
expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives
no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor
under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or
otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this
Agreement are reserved.

This Agreement is governed by the laws of the
State of New York and the intellectual property laws of the United
States of America. No party to this Agreement will bring a legal
action under this Agreement more than one year after the cause of
action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in any
resulting litigation.

EUPL (c) the European Community
2007 

This European Union Public Licence (the “EUPL”) applies to
the Work or Software (as defined below) which is provided under the
terms of this Licence. Any use of the Work, other than as authorised
under this Licence is prohibited (to the extent such use is covered by
a right of the copyright holder of the Work). 

The Original Work is
provided under the terms of this Licence when the Licensor (as defined
below) has placed the following notice immediately following the
copyright notice for the Original Work: 

     Licensed under the EUPL
V.1.0 

or has expressed by any other mean his willingness to license
under the EUPL. 

1. Definitions

In this Licence, the following terms
have the following meaning: 

     − The Licence: this Licence. 

  
  − The Original Work or the Software: the software distributed
and/or communicated by the Licensor under this Licence, available as
Source Code and also as Executable Code as the case may be. 

     −
Derivative Works: the works or software that could be created by the
Licensee, based upon the Original Work or modifications thereof. This
Licence does not define the extent of modification or dependence on
the Original Work required in order to classify a work as a Derivative
Work; this extent is determined by copyright law applicable in the
country mentioned in Article 15. 

     − The Work: the Original
Work and/or its Derivative Works. 

     − The Source Code: the
human-readable form of the Work which is the most convenient for
people to study and modify. 

     − The Executable Code: any code
which has generally been compiled and which is meant to be interpreted
by a computer as a program. 

     − The Licensor: the natural or
legal person that distributes and/or communicates the Work under the
Licence. 

     − Contributor(s): any natural or legal person who
modifies the Work under the Licence, or otherwise contributes to the
creation of a Derivative Work. 

     − The Licensee or “You”:
any natural or legal person who makes any usage of the Software under
the terms of the Licence. − Distribution and/or Communication: any
act of selling, giving, lending, renting, distributing, communicating,
transmitting, or otherwise making available, on-line or off-line,
copies of the Work at the disposal of any other natural or legal
person. 

2. Scope of the rights granted by the Licence

The Licensor
hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive,
sub-licensable licence to do the following, for the duration of
copyright vested in the Original Work: 

     − use the Work in any
circumstance and for all usage, 
     
     − reproduce the Work, 
 
   
     − modify the Original Work, and make Derivative Works based
upon the Work, 
     
     − communicate to the public, including
the right to make available or display the Work or copies thereof to
the public and perform publicly, as the case may be, the Work, 

    
− distribute the Work or copies thereof, 

     − lend and rent
the Work or copies thereof, 

     − sub-license rights in the Work
or copies thereof. 

Those rights can be exercised on any media,
supports and formats, whether now known or later invented, as far as
the applicable law permits so. 

In the countries where moral rights
apply, the Licensor waives his right to exercise his moral right to
the extent allowed by law in order to make effective the licence of
the economic rights here above listed. 

The Licensor grants to the
Licensee royalty-free, non exclusive usage rights to any patents held
by the Licensor, to the extent necessary to make use of the rights
granted on the Work under this Licence. 

3. Communication of the
Source Code

The Licensor may provide the Work either in its Source
Code form, or as Executable Code. If the Work is provided as
Executable Code, the Licensor provides in addition a machinereadable
copy of the Source Code of the Work along with each copy of the Work
that the Licensor distributes or indicates, in a notice following the
copyright notice attached to the Work, a repository where the Source
Code is easily and freely accessible for as long as the Licensor
continues to distribute and/or communicate the Work. 

4. Limitations
on copyright

Nothing in this Licence is intended to deprive the
Licensee of the benefits from any exception or limitation to the
exclusive rights of the rights owners in the Original Work or
Software, of the exhaustion of those rights or of other applicable
limitations thereto. 

5. Obligations of the Licensee

The grant of
the rights mentioned above is subject to some restrictions and
obligations imposed on the Licensee. Those obligations are the
following: 

Attribution right: the Licensee shall keep intact all
copyright, patent or trademarks notices and all notices that refer to
the Licence and to the disclaimer of warranties. The Licensee must
include a copy of such notices and a copy of the Licence with every
copy of the Work he/she distributes and/or communicates. The Licensee
must cause any Derivative Work to carry prominent notices stating that
the Work has been modified and the date of modification. 

Copyleft
clause: If the Licensee distributes and/or communicates copies of the
Original Works or Derivative Works based upon the Original Work, this
Distribution and/or Communication will be done under the terms of this
Licence. The Licensee (becoming Licensor) cannot offer or impose any
additional terms or conditions on the Work or Derivative Work that
alter or restrict the terms of the Licence. 

Compatibility clause: If
the Licensee Distributes and/or Communicates Derivative Works or
copies thereof based upon both the Original Work and another work
licensed under a Compatible Licence, this Distribution and/or
Communication can be done under the terms of this Compatible Licence.
For the sake of this clause, “Compatible Licence” refers to the
licences listed in the appendix attached to this Licence. Should the
Licensee’s obligations under the Compatible Licence conflict with
his/her obligations under this Licence, the obligations of the
Compatible Licence shall prevail. 

Provision of Source Code: When
distributing and/or communicating copies of the Work, the Licensee
will provide a machine-readable copy of the Source Code or indicate a
repository where this Source will be easily and freely available for
as long as the Licensee continues to distribute and/or communicate the
Work. 

Legal Protection: This Licence does not grant permission to
use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or names of the
Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in
describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the
copyright notice. 

6. Chain of Authorship

The original Licensor
warrants that the copyright in the Original Work granted hereunder is
owned by him/her or licensed to him/her and that he/she has the power
and authority to grant the Licence. 

Each Contributor warrants that
the copyright in the modifications he/she brings to the Work are owned
by him/her or licensed to him/her and that he/she has the power and
authority to grant the Licence. 

Each time You, as a Licensee,
receive the Work, the original Licensor and subsequent Contributors
grant You a licence to their contributions to the Work, under the
terms of this Licence. 

7. Disclaimer of Warranty

The Work is a work
in progress, which is continuously improved by numerous contributors.
It is not a finished work and may therefore contain defects or
“bugs” inherent to this type of software development. 

For the
above reason, the Work is provided under the Licence on an “as is”
basis and without warranties of any kind concerning the Work,
including without limitation merchantability, fitness for a particular
purpose, absence of defects or errors, accuracy, non-infringement of
intellectual property rights other than copyright as stated in Article
6 of this Licence. 

This disclaimer of warranty is an essential part
of the Licence and a condition for the grant of any rights to the
Work. 

8. Disclaimer of Liability

Except in the cases of wilful
misconduct or damages directly caused to natural persons, the Licensor
will in no event be liable for any direct or indirect, material or
moral, damages of any kind, arising out of the Licence or of the use
of the Work, including without limitation, damages for loss of
goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, loss of data
or any commercial damage, even if the Licensor has been advised of the
possibility of such damage. However, the Licensor will be liable under
statutory product liability laws as far such laws apply to the Work.


9. Additional agreements

While distributing the Original Work or
Derivative Works, You may choose to conclude an additional agreement
to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty,
indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or services consistent
with this Licence. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act
only on your own behalf and on your sole responsibility, not on behalf
of the original Licensor or any other Contributor, and only if You
agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any
liability incurred by, or claims asserted against such Contributor by
the fact You have accepted any such warranty or additional liability.


10. Acceptance of the Licence

The provisions of this Licence can be
accepted by clicking on an icon “I agree” placed under the bottom
of a window displaying the text of this Licence or by affirming
consent in any other similar way, in accordance with the rules of
applicable law. Clicking on that icon indicates your clear and
irrevocable acceptance of this Licence and all of its terms and
conditions. 

Similarly, you irrevocably accept this Licence and all
of its terms and conditions by exercising any rights granted to You by
Article 2 of this Licence, such as the use of the Work, the creation
by You of a Derivative Work or the Distribution and/or Communication
by You of the Work or copies thereof. 

11. Information to the
public

In case of any Distribution and/or Communication of the Work
by means of electronic communication by You (for example, by offering
to download the Work from a remote location) the distribution channel
or media (for example, a website) must at least provide to the public
the information requested by the applicable law regarding the
identification and address of the Licensor, the Licence and the way it
may be accessible, concluded, stored and reproduced by the Licensee.


12. Termination of the Licence

The Licence and the rights granted
hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by the Licensee
of the terms of the Licence. 

Such a termination will not terminate
the licences of any person who has received the Work from the Licensee

EUPL (c) the European Community
2007

This European Union Public Licence (the ""EUPL"") applies to the
Work or Software (as defined below) which is provided under the terms
of this Licence. Any use of the Work, other than as authorised under
this Licence is prohibited (to the extent such use is covered by a
right of the copyright holder of the Work).

The Original Work is
provided under the terms of this Licence when the Licensor (as defined
below) has placed the following notice immediately following the
copyright notice for the Original Work: 

     Licensed under the EUPL
V.1.1 

or has expressed by any other mean his willingness to license
under the EUPL.

1. Definitions

In this Licence, the following terms
have the following meaning:

     - The Licence: this Licence.

     -
The Original Work or the Software: the software distributed and/or
communicated by the Licensor under this Licence, available as Source
Code and also as Executable Code as the case may be.

     -
Derivative Works: the works or software that could be created by the
Licensee, based upon the Original Work or modifications thereof. This
Licence does not define the extent of modification or dependence on
the Original Work required in order to classify a work as a Derivative
Work; this extent is determined by copyright law applicable in the
country mentioned in Article 15.

     - The Work: the Original Work
and/or its Derivative Works.

     - The Source Code: the
human-readable form of the Work which is the most convenient for
people to study and modify.

     - The Executable Code: any code
which has generally been compiled and which is meant to be interpreted
by a computer as a program.

     - The Licensor: the natural or legal
person that distributes and/or communicates the Work under the
Licence.

     - Contributor(s): any natural or legal person who
modifies the Work under the Licence, or otherwise contributes to the
creation of a Derivative Work.

     - The Licensee or ""You"": any
natural or legal person who makes any usage of the Software under the
terms of the Licence.

     - Distribution and/or Communication: any
act of selling, giving, lending, renting, distributing, communicating,
transmitting, or otherwise making available, on-line or off-line,
copies of the Work or providing access to its essential
functionalities at the disposal of any other natural or legal
person.

2. Scope of the rights granted by the Licence

The Licensor
hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive,
sublicensable licence to do the following, for the duration of
copyright vested in the Original Work:

     - use the Work in any
circumstance and for all usage, 

     - reproduce the Work, 

     -
modify the Original Work, and make Derivative Works based upon the
Work, 

     - communicate to the public, including the right to make
available or display the Work or copies thereof to the public and
perform publicly, as the case may be, the Work, 

     - distribute
the Work or copies thereof, 

     - lend and rent the Work or copies
thereof, 

     - sub-license rights in the Work or copies
thereof.

Those rights can be exercised on any media, supports and
formats, whether now known or later invented, as far as the applicable
law permits so.

In the countries where moral rights apply, the
Licensor waives his right to exercise his moral right to the extent
allowed by law in order to make effective the licence of the economic
rights here above listed.

The Licensor grants to the Licensee
royalty-free, non exclusive usage rights to any patents held by the
Licensor, to the extent necessary to make use of the rights granted on
the Work under this Licence.

3. Communication of the Source Code

The
Licensor may provide the Work either in its Source Code form, or as
Executable Code. If the Work is provided as Executable Code, the
Licensor provides in addition a machine-readable copy of the Source
Code of the Work along with each copy of the Work that the Licensor
distributes or indicates, in a notice following the copyright notice
attached to the Work, a repository where the Source Code is easily and
freely accessible for as long as the Licensor continues to distribute
and/or communicate the Work.

4. Limitations on copyright

Nothing in
this Licence is intended to deprive the Licensee of the benefits from
any exception or limitation to the exclusive rights of the rights
owners in the Original Work or Software, of the exhaustion of those
rights or of other applicable limitations thereto.

5. Obligations of
the Licensee

The grant of the rights mentioned above is subject to
some restrictions and obligations imposed on the Licensee. Those
obligations are the following:

Attribution right: the Licensee shall
keep intact all copyright, patent or trademarks notices and all
notices that refer to the Licence and to the disclaimer of warranties.
The Licensee must include a copy of such notices and a copy of the
Licence with every copy of the Work he/she distributes and/or
communicates. The Licensee must cause any Derivative Work to carry
prominent notices stating that the Work has been modified and the date
of modification.

Copyleft clause: If the Licensee distributes and/or
communicates copies of the Original Works or Derivative Works based
upon the Original Work, this Distribution and/or Communication will be
done under the terms of this Licence or of a later version of this
Licence unless the Original Work is expressly distributed only under
this version of the Licence. The Licensee (becoming Licensor) cannot
offer or impose any additional terms or conditions on the Work or
Derivative Work that alter or restrict the terms of the
Licence.

Compatibility clause: If the Licensee Distributes and/or
Communicates Derivative Works or copies thereof based upon both the
Original Work and another work licensed under a Compatible Licence,
this Distribution and/or Communication can be done under the terms of
this Compatible Licence. For the sake of this clause, ""Compatible
Licence,"" refers to the licences listed in the appendix attached to
this Licence. Should the Licensee's obligations under the Compatible
Licence conflict with his/her obligations under this Licence, the
obligations of the Compatible Licence shall prevail.

Provision of
Source Code: When distributing and/or communicating copies of the
Work, the Licensee will provide a machine-readable copy of the Source
Code or indicate a repository where this Source will be easily and
freely available for as long as the Licensee continues to distribute
and/or communicate the Work.

Legal Protection: This Licence does not
grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or
names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary
use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content
of the copyright notice.

6. Chain of Authorship

The original
Licensor warrants that the copyright in the Original Work granted
hereunder is owned by him/her or licensed to him/her and that he/she
has the power and authority to grant the Licence.

Each Contributor
warrants that the copyright in the modifications he/she brings to the
Work are owned by him/her or licensed to him/her and that he/she has
the power and authority to grant the Licence.

Each time You accept
the Licence, the original Licensor and subsequent Contributors grant
You a licence to their contributions to the Work, under the terms of
this Licence.

7. Disclaimer of Warranty

The Work is a work in
progress, which is continuously improved by numerous contributors. It
is not a finished work and may therefore contain defects or ""bugs""
inherent to this type of software development.

For the above reason,
the Work is provided under the Licence on an ""as is"" basis and without
warranties of any kind concerning the Work, including without
limitation merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, absence
of defects or errors, accuracy, non-infringement of intellectual
property rights other than copyright as stated in Article 6 of this
Licence.

This disclaimer of warranty is an essential part of the
Licence and a condition for the grant of any rights to the Work.

8.
Disclaimer of Liability

Except in the cases of wilful misconduct or
damages directly caused to natural persons, the Licensor will in no
event be liable for any direct or indirect, material or moral, damages
of any kind, arising out of the Licence or of the use of the Work,
including without limitation, damages for loss of goodwill, work
stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, loss of data or any
commercial damage, even if the Licensor has been advised of the
possibility of such damage. However, the Licensor will be liable under
statutory product liability laws as far such laws apply to the
Work.

9. Additional agreements

While distributing the Original Work
or Derivative Works, You may choose to conclude an additional
agreement to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support,
warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or services
consistent with this Licence. However, in accepting such obligations,
You may act only on your own behalf and on your sole responsibility,
not on behalf of the original Licensor or any other Contributor, and
only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor
harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against
such Contributor by the fact You have accepted any such warranty or
additional liability.

10. Acceptance of the Licence

The provisions
of this Licence can be accepted by clicking on an icon ""I agree""
placed under the bottom of a window displaying the text of this
Licence or by affirming consent in any other similar way, in
accordance with the rules of applicable law. Clicking on that icon
indicates your clear and irrevocable acceptance of this Licence and
all of its terms and conditions.

Similarly, you irrevocably accept
this Licence and all of its terms and conditions by exercising any
rights granted to You by Article 2 of this Licence, such as the use of
the Work, the creation by You of a Derivative Work or the Distribution
and/or Communication by You of the Work or copies thereof.

11.
Information to the public

In case of any Distribution and/or
Communication of the Work by means of electronic communication by You
(for example, by offering to download the Work from a remote location)
the distribution channel or media (for example, a website) must at
least provide to the public the information requested by the
applicable law regarding the Licensor, the Licence and the way it may
be accessible, concluded, stored and reproduced by the Licensee.

12.
Termination of the Licence

The Licence and the rights granted
hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by the Licensee
of the terms of the Licence. Such a termination will not terminate the
licences of any person who has received the Work from the Licensee
under the Licence, provided such persons remain in full compliance
with the Licence.

13. Miscellaneous

Without prejudice of Article 9
above, the Licence represents the complete agreement between the
Parties as to the Work licensed hereunder.

If any provision of the
Licence is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, this will
not affect the validity or enforceability of the Licence as a whole.
Such provision will be construed and/or reformed so as necessary to
make it valid and enforceable.

The European Commission may publish
other linguistic versions and/or new versions of this Licence, so far
this is required and reasonable, without reducing the scope of the
rights granted by the Licence. New versions of the Licence will be
published with a unique version number.

All linguistic versions of
this Licence, approved by the European Commission, have identical
value. Parties can take advantage of the linguistic version of their
choice.

14. Jurisdiction

Any litigation resulting from the
interpretation of this License, arising between the European
Commission, as a Licensor, and any Licensee, will be subject to the
jurisdiction of the Court of Justice of the European Communities, as
laid down in article 238 of the Treaty establishing the European
Community.

Any litigation arising between Parties, other than the
European Commission, and resulting from the interpretation of this
License, will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the
competent court where the Licensor resides or conducts its primary
business.

15. Applicable Law

This Licence shall be governed by the
law of the European Union country where the Licensor resides or has
his registered office.

This licence shall be governed by the Belgian
law if:

     - a litigation arises between the European Commission,
as a Licensor, and any Licensee; 

     - the Licensor, other than the
European Commission, has no residence or registered office inside a
European Union country.

Introduction


The FreeType Project is distributed in several archive packages;
some of them may contain, in addition to the FreeType font engine,
various tools and contributions which rely on, or relate to, the
FreeType Project.

This license applies to all files found in such
packages, and which do not fall under their own explicit license. The
license affects thus the FreeType font engine, the test programs,
documentation and makefiles, at the very least.

This license was
inspired by the BSD, Artistic, and IJG (Independent JPEG Group)
licenses, which all encourage inclusion and use of free software in
commercial and freeware products alike. As a consequence, its main
points are that:

     o We don't promise that this software works.
However, we will be interested in any kind of bug reports. (`as is'
distribution)

     o You can use this software for whatever you want,
in parts or full form, without having to pay us. (`royalty-free'
usage)

     o You may not pretend that you wrote this software. If
you use it, or only parts of it, in a program, you must acknowledge
somewhere in your documentation that you have used the FreeType code.
(`credits')

We specifically permit and encourage the inclusion of
this software, with or without modifications, in commercial products.
We disclaim all warranties covering The FreeType Project and assume no
liability related to The FreeType Project. 

Finally, many people
asked us for a preferred form for a credit/disclaimer to use in
compliance with this license. We thus encourage you to use the
following text:

     """""" Portions of this software are copyright ©
<year> The FreeType Project (www.freetype.org). All rights reserved.
""""""

Please replace <year> with the value from the FreeType version
you actually use. 

Legal Terms 

0. Definitions 

Throughout this
license, the terms `package', `FreeType Project', and `FreeType
archive' refer to the set of files originally distributed by the
authors (David Turner, Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg) as the
`FreeType Project', be they named as alpha, beta or final
release.

`You' refers to the licensee, or person using the project,
where `using' is a generic term including compiling the project's
source code as well as linking it to form a `program' or `executable'.
This program is referred to as `a program using the FreeType
engine'.

This license applies to all files distributed in the
original FreeType Project, including all source code, binaries and
documentation, unless otherwise stated in the file in its original,
unmodified form as distributed in the original archive. If you are
unsure whether or not a particular file is covered by this license,
you must contact us to verify this.

The FreeType Project is copyright
(C) 1996-2000 by David Turner, Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg. All
rights reserved except as specified below.

1. No Warranty 

THE
FREETYPE PROJECT IS PROVIDED `AS IS' WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, WARRANTIES
OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. IN NO EVENT
WILL ANY OF THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES
CAUSED BY THE USE OR THE INABILITY TO USE, OF THE FREETYPE
PROJECT.

2. Redistribution

This license grants a worldwide,
royalty-free, perpetual and irrevocable right and license to use,
execute, perform, compile, display, copy, create derivative works of,
distribute and sublicense the FreeType Project (in both source and
object code forms) and derivative works thereof for any purpose; and
to authorize others to exercise some or all of the rights granted
herein, subject to the following conditions:

     o Redistribution of
source code must retain this license file (`FTL.TXT') unaltered; any
additions, deletions or changes to the original files must be clearly
indicated in accompanying documentation. The copyright notices of the
unaltered, original files must be preserved in all copies of source
files.

     o Redistribution in binary form must provide a disclaimer
that states that the software is based in part of the work of the
FreeType Team, in the distribution documentation. We also encourage
you to put an URL to the FreeType web page in your documentation,
though this isn't mandatory.

These conditions apply to any software
derived from or based on the FreeType Project, not just the unmodified
files. If you use our work, you must acknowledge us. However, no fee
need be paid to us.

3. Advertising 

Neither the FreeType authors and
contributors nor you shall use the name of the other for commercial,
advertising, or promotional purposes without specific prior written
permission.

We suggest, but do not require, that you use one or more
of the following phrases to refer to this software in your
documentation or advertising materials: `FreeType Project', `FreeType
Engine', `FreeType library', or `FreeType Distribution'.

As you have
not signed this license, you are not required to accept it. However,
as the FreeType Project is copyrighted material, only this license, or
another one contracted with the authors, grants you the right to use,
distribute, and modify it. Therefore, by using, distributing, or
modifying the FreeType Project, you indicate that you understand and
accept all the terms of this license.

4. Contacts 

There are two
mailing lists related to FreeType:

     o freetype@nongnu.org

    
Discusses general use and applications of FreeType, as well as future
and wanted additions to the library and distribution. If you are
looking for support, start in this list if you haven't found anything
to help you in the documentation.

     o freetype-devel@nongnu.org

 
   Discusses bugs, as well as engine internals, design issues,
specific licenses, porting, etc.

modifications, additions and deletions to the content or structure of
the Frameworx Code Base; or

     (c) create larger works or
derivative works including the Frameworx Code Base or any portion or
element thereof; and

     (d) release, distribute or make available,
either generally or to any specific third-party, any of the foregoing
in Source Code or binary form.

3. License Conditions. The grant of
the License under Section 1 hereof, and your exercise of all rights in
connection with this License Agreement, will remain subject to the
following terms and conditions, as well as to the other provisions
hereof:

     (a)     Complete Source Code for any Downstream
Distribution directly or indirectly made by You that contains, or
depends for its intended functionality on, the Frameworx Code Base, or
any portion or element thereof, shall be made freely available to all
users thereof on terms and conditions no more restrictive, and no less
favorable for any user (including, without limitation, with regard to
Source Code availability and royalty-free use) than those terms and
conditions provided in this License Agreement.

     (b)     Any
Value-Added Services that you offer or provide, directly or
indirectly, in relation to any Downstream Distribution shall be
offered and provided on commercial terms that are reasonably
commensurate to the fair market value of such Value-Added Services. In
addition, the terms and conditions on which any such Value Added
Services are so offered or provided shall be consistent with, and
shall fully support, the intent and purpose of this License
Agreement.

     (c)     All Downstream Distributions shall:

        
 (i) include all portions and elements of the Frameworx Code Base
required to build the Source Code of such Downstream Distribution into
a fully functional machine-executable system, or additional build
scripts or comparable software necessary and sufficient for such
purposes;

          (ii) include, in each file containing any portion
or element of the Frameworx Code Base, the following identifying
legend: This file contains software that has been made available under
The Frameworx Open License 1.0. Use and distribution hereof are
subject to the restrictions set forth therein.

          (iii)
include all other copyright notices, authorship credits, warranty
disclaimers (including that provided in Section 6 below), legends,
documentation, annotations and comments contained in the Frameworx
Code Base as provided to You hereunder;

          (iv) contain an
unaltered copy of the html file named
frameworx_community_invitation.html included within the Frameworx Code
Base that acknowledges new users and provides them with information on
the Frameworx Code Base community;

          (v) contain an unaltered
copy of the text file named the_frameworx_license.txt included within
the Frameworx Code Base that includes a text copy of the form of this
License Agreement; and

          (vi) prominently display to any
viewer or user of the Source Code of such Open Downstream
Distribution, in the place and manner normally used for such displays,
the following legend:

Source code licensed under from The Frameworx
Company is contained herein, and such source code has been obtained
either under The Frameworx Open License, or another license granted by
The Frameworx Company. Use and distribution hereof is subject to the
restrictions provided in the relevant such license and to the
copyrights of the licensor thereunder. A copy of The Frameworx Open
License is provided in a file named the_frameworx_license.txt and

4. Restrictions on Open Downstream
Distributions. Each Downstream Distribution made by You, and by any
party directly or indirectly obtaining rights to the Frameworx Code
Base through You, shall be made subject to a license grant or
agreement to the extent necessary so that each distributee under that
Downstream Distribution will be subject to the same restrictions on
re-distribution and use as are binding on You hereunder. You may
satisfy this licensing requirement either by:

     (a) requiring as a
condition to any Downstream Distribution made by you, or by any direct
or indirect distributee of Your Downstream Distribution (or any
portion or element thereof), that each distributee under the relevant
Downstream Distribution obtain a direct license (on the same terms and
conditions as those in this License Agreement) from The Frameworx
Company; or

     (b) sub-licensing all (and not less than all) of
Your rights and obligations hereunder to that distributee, including
(without limitation) Your obligation to require distributees to be
bound by license restrictions as contemplated by this Section 4
above.

The Frameworx Company hereby grants to you all rights to
sub-license your rights hereunder as necessary to fully effect the
intent and purpose of this Section 4 above, provided, however, that
your rights and obligations hereunder shall be unaffected by any such
sublicensing. In addition, The Frameworx Company expressly retains all
rights to take all appropriate action (including legal action) against
any such direct or indirect sub-licensee to ensure its full compliance
with the intent and purposes of this License Agreement.

5.
Intellectual Property. Except as expressly provided herein, this
License Agreement preserves and respects Your and The Frameworx
Companys respective intellectual property rights, including, in the
case of The Frameworx Company, its copyrights and patent rights
relating to the Frameworx Code Base.

6. Warranty Disclaimer. THE
SOFTWARE LICENSED HEREUNDER IS PROVIDED ``AS IS.'' ANY EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND
NON-INFRINGEMENT, ARE HEREBY DISCLAIMED. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE
LICENSOR OF THIS SOFTWARE, BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT,
INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES INCLUDING
(BUT NOT LIMITED TO) PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES; LOSS
OF USE, DATA, OR PROFITS; OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION) HOWEVER CAUSED AND
ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY OR
TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE
USE OF THIS SOFTWARE, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

7. License Violation. The License, and all of your rights
thereunder, shall be deemed automatically terminated and void as of
any Downstream Distribution directly or indirectly made or facilitated
by You that violates the provisions of this License Agreement,
provided, however, that this License Agreement shall survive any such
termination in order to remedy the effects of such violation. This
License Agreement shall be binding on the legal successors and assigns
of the parties hereto.

Your agreement to the foregoing as of the date
hereof has been evidenced by your acceptance of the relevant software
distribution hereunder.

(or portions thereof), but solely to the extent that any such patent
is reasonably necessary to enable You to Utilize the Contributor
Version (or portions thereof), and not to any greater extent that may
be necessary to Utilize further Modifications or combinations.

3.
Distribution Obligations.

     3.1. Application of License.
     The
Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are governed
by the terms of this License, including without limitation Section
2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be distributed only
under the terms of this License or a future version of this License
released under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of this
License with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not
offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or
restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients'
rights hereunder. However, You may include an additional document
offering the additional rights described in Section 3.5.

     3.2.
Availability of Source Code.
     Any Modification which You create or
to which You contribute must be made available in Source Code form
under the terms of this License either on the same media as an
Executable version or via an accepted Electronic Distribution
Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable version available;
and if made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must
remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it
initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a
subsequent version of that particular Modification has been made
available to such recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that
the Source Code version remains available even if the Electronic
Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.

     3.3.
Description of Modifications.
     You must cause all Covered Code to
which you contribute to contain a file documenting the changes You
made to create that Covered Code and the date of any change. You must
include a prominent statement that the Modification is derived,
directly or indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial
Developer and including the name of the Initial Developer in (a) the
Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version or related
documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership of the
Covered Code.

     3.4. Intellectual Property Matters

          (a)
Third Party Claims.
          If You have knowledge that a party
claims an intellectual property right in particular functionality or
code (or its utilization under this License), you must include a text
file with the source code distribution titled ""LEGAL"" which describes
the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a
recipient will know whom to contact. If you obtain such knowledge
after You make Your Modification available as described in Section
3.2, You shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies You make
available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying
appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to
inform those who received the Covered Code that new knowledge has been
obtained.

          (b) Contributor APIs.
          If Your
Modification is an application programming interface and You own or
control patents which are reasonably necessary to implement that API,
you must also include this information in the LEGAL file.

     3.5.
Required Notices.
     You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in
each file of the Source Code, and this License in any documentation
for the Source Code, where You describe recipients' rights relating to
Covered Code. If You created one or more Modification(s), You may add
your name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. If it
is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file
due to its structure, then you must include such notice in a location
(such as a relevant directory file) where a user would be likely to
look for such a notice. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee
for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or
more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your
own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any
Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty,
support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone,
and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every
Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or
such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or
liability terms You offer.

     3.6. Distribution of Executable
Versions.
     You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only
if the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered
Code, and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version
of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License,
including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the
obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included
in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or
collateral in which You descr ibe recipients' rights relating to the
Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered
Code under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different
from this License,provided that You are in compliance with the terms
of this License and that the license for the Executable version does
not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source
Code version from the rights set forth in this License. If You
distribute the Executable version under a different license You must
make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License
are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any
Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and
every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer
or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.

    
3.7. Larger Works.
     You may create a Larger Work by combining
Covered Code with other code not governed by the terms of this License
and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case,
You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for
the Covered Code.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or
Regulation.
If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the
terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code
due to statute or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms
of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the
limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be
included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must be
included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the
extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be
sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to
understand it.

5. Application of this License.
This License applies
to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the notice in
Exhibit A, and to related Covered Code.

6. Versions of the License.


    6.1. New Versions.
     Floris van den Berg may publish revised
and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version
will be given a distinguishing version number.

     6.2. Effect of
New Versions.
     Once Covered Code has been published under a
particular version of the License, You may always continue to use it
under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such
Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the License
published by Floris van den Berg
No one other than Floris van den Berg
has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created
under this License.

     6.3. Derivative Works.
     If you create or
use a modified version of this License (which you may only do in order
to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code governed by this
License), you must (a) rename Your license so that the phrases
""FreeImage"", `FreeImage Public License"", ""FIPL"", or any confusingly
similar phrase do not appear anywhere in your license and (b)
otherwise make it clear that your version of the license contains
terms which differ from the FreeImage Public License. (Filling in the
name of the Initial Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the
notice described in Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be
modifications of this License.)

7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.
COVERED
CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN ""AS IS"" BASIS, WITHOUT
WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS,
MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE
ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS
WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU
(NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST
OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF
WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY
COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

8.
TERMINATION.
This License and the rights granted hereunder will
terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and
fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the
breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted
shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by
their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this
License shall survive.

9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.
UNDER NO
CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING
NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY
OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER
OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY OTHER PERSON FOR ANY
INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY
CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL,
WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER
COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN
INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF
LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY
RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW
PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE
EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO
THAT EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

10. U.S.
GOVERNMENT END USERS.
The Covered Code is a ""commercial item,"" as that
term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of
""commercial computer software"" and ""commercial computer software
documentation,"" as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept.
1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1
through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire
Covered Code with only those rights set forth herein.

11.
MISCELLANEOUS.
This License represents the complete agreement
concerning subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is
held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the
extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be
governed by Dutch law provisions (except to the extent applicable law,
if any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions.
With respect to disputes in which at least one party is a citizen of,
or an entity chartered or registered to do business in, the The
Netherlands: (a) unless otherwise agreed in writing, all disputes
relating to this License (excepting any dispute relating to
intellectual property rights) shall be subject to final and binding
arbitration, with the losing party paying all costs of arbitration;
(b) any arbitration relating to this Agreement shall be held in
Almelo, The Netherlands; and (c) any litigation relating to this
Agreement shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the court of Almelo,
The Netherlands with the losing party responsible for costs, including
without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys fees and
expenses. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a
contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to
this License.

12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.
Except in cases where
another Contributor has failed to comply with Section 3.4, You are
responsible for damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of Your
utilization of rights under this License, based on the number of
copies of Covered Code you made available, the revenues you received
from utilizing such rights, and other relevant factors. You agree to
work with affected parties to distribute responsibility on an
equitable basis.

GCC Linking Exception
In addition to the
permissions in the GNU General Public License, the Free Software
Foundation gives you unlimited permission to link the compiled version
of this file into combinations with other programs, and to distribute
those combinations without any restriction coming from the use of this
file. (The General Public License restrictions do apply in other
respects; for example, they cover modification of the file, and
distribution when not linked into a combine executable.)

As a special
exception, the Free Software Foundation gives unlimited permission to
copy, distribute and modify the configure scripts that are the output
of Autoconf. You need not follow the terms of the GNU General Public
License when using or distributing such scripts, even though portions
of the text of Autoconf appear in them. The GNU General Public License
(GPL) does govern all other use of the material that constitutes the
Autoconf program.

Certain portions of the Autoconf source text are
designed to be copied (in certain cases, depending on the input) into
the output of Autoconf. We call these the ""data"" portions. The rest of
the Autoconf source text consists of comments plus executable code
that decides which of the data portions to output in any given case.
We call these comments and executable code the ""non-data"" portions.
Autoconf never copies any of the non-data portions into its
output.

This special exception to the GPL applies to versions of
Autoconf released by the Free Software Foundation. When you make and
distribute a modified version of Autoconf, you may extend this special
exception to the GPL to apply to your modified version as well,
*unless* your modified version has the potential to copy into its
output some of the text that was the non-data portion of the version
that you started with. (In other words, unless your change moves or
copies text from the non-data portions to the data portions.) If your
modification has such potential, you must delete any notice of this
special exception to the GPL from your modified version.

As a special exception, you may create a larger work
that contains part or all of the Bison parser skeleton and distribute
that work under terms of your choice, so long as that work isn't
itself a parser generator using the skeleton or a modified version
thereof as a parser skeleton. Alternatively, if you modify or
redistribute the parser skeleton itself, you may (at your option)
remove this special exception, which will cause the skeleton and the
resulting Bison output files to be licensed under the GNU General
Public License without this special exception.

This special exception
was added by the Free Software Foundation in version 2.2 of Bison.

GCC RUNTIME LIBRARY EXCEPTION
Version 3.1,
31 March 2009

General
information:
http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gcc-exception.html
Copyright
(C) 2009 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>

Everyone is
permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license
document, but changing it is not allowed.
This GCC Runtime Library
Exception (""Exception"") is an additional permission under section 7 of
the GNU General Public License, version 3 (""GPLv3""). It applies to a
given file (the ""Runtime Library"") that bears a notice placed by the
copyright holder of the file stating that the file is governed by
GPLv3 along with this Exception.

When you use GCC to compile a
program, GCC may combine portions of certain GCC header files and
runtime libraries with the compiled program. The purpose of this
Exception is to allow compilation of non-GPL (including proprietary)
programs to use, in this way, the header files and runtime libraries
covered by this Exception.

0. Definitions.
A file is an ""Independent
Module"" if it either requires the Runtime Library for execution after
a Compilation Process, or makes use of an interface provided by the
Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based on the Runtime
Library.
""GCC"" means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or
without modifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later
version) of the GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of
using any subsequent versions published by the FSF.
""GPL-compatible
Software"" is software whose conditions of propagation, modification
and use would permit combination with GCC in accord with the license
of GCC.

""Target Code"" refers to output from any compiler for a real
or virtual target processor architecture, in executable form or
suitable for input to an assembler, loader, linker and/or execution
phase. Notwithstanding that, Target Code does not include data in any
format that is used as a compiler intermediate representation, or used
for producing a compiler intermediate representation.
The ""Compilation
Process"" transforms code entirely represented in non-intermediate
languages designed for human-written code, and/or in Java Virtual
Machine byte code, into Target Code. Thus, for example, use of source
code generators and preprocessors need not be considered part of the
Compilation Process, since the Compilation Process can be understood
as starting with the output of the generators or preprocessors.

A
Compilation Process is ""Eligible"" if it is done using GCC, alone or
with other GPL-compatible software, or if it is done without using any
work based on GCC. For example, using non-GPL-compatible Software to
optimize any GCC intermediate representations would not qualify as an
Eligible Compilation Process.

1. Grant of Additional Permission.
You
have permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by combining
the Runtime Library with Independent Modules, even if such propagation
would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3, provided that all Target
Code was generated by Eligible Compilation Processes. You may then
convey such a combination under terms of your choice, consistent with
the licensing of the Independent Modules.

2. No Weakening of GCC
Copyleft.
The availability of this Exception does not imply any
general presumption that third-party software is unaffected by the
copyleft requirements of the license of GCC.

AUTOCONF CONFIGURE SCRIPT EXCEPTION

Version
3.0, 18 August 2009

Copyright © 2009 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
<http://fsf.org/>

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute
verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not
allowed.

This Exception is an additional permission under section 7
of the GNU General Public License, version 3 (""GPLv3""). It applies to
a given file that bears a notice placed by the copyright holder of the
file stating that the file is governed by GPLv3 along with this
Exception.

The purpose of this Exception is to allow distribution of
Autoconf's typical output under terms of the recipient's choice
(including proprietary).

0. Definitions.
""Covered Code"" is the source
or object code of a version of Autoconf that is a covered work under
this License.

""Normally Copied Code"" for a version of Autoconf means
all parts of its Covered Code which that version can copy from its
code (i.e., not from its input file) into its minimally verbose,
non-debugging and non-tracing output.

""Ineligible Code"" is Covered
Code that is not Normally Copied Code.

1. Grant of Additional
Permission.
You have permission to propagate output of Autoconf, even
if such propagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3.
However, if by modifying Autoconf you cause any Ineligible Code of the
version you received to become Normally Copied Code of your modified
version, then you void this Exception for the resulting covered work.
If you convey that resulting covered work, you must remove this
Exception in accordance with the second paragraph of Section 7 of
GPLv3.

2. No Weakening of Autoconf Copyleft.
The availability of this
Exception does not imply any general presumption that third-party
software is unaffected by the copyleft requirements of the license of
Autoconf.

Allegro is gift-ware. It was created
by a number of people working in cooperation, and is given to you
freely as a gift. You may use, modify, redistribute, and generally
hack it about in any way you like, and you do not have to give us
anything in return.

However, if you like this product you are
encouraged to thank us by making a return gift to the Allegro
community. This could be by writing an add-on package, providing a
useful bug report, making an improvement to the library, or perhaps
just releasing the sources of your program so that other people can
learn from them. If you redistribute parts of this code or make a game
using it, it would be nice if you mentioned Allegro somewhere in the
credits, but you are not required to do this. We trust you not to
abuse our generosity.

1. PREAMBLE

This
license is for software that provides a 3D graphics application
program interface (API).The license is intended to offer terms similar
to some standard General Public Licenses designed to foster open
standards and unrestricted accessibility to source code. Some of these
licenses require that, as a condition of the license of the software,
any derivative works (that is, new software which is a work containing
the original program or a portion of it) must be available for general
use, without restriction other than for a minor transfer fee, and that
the source code for such derivative works must likewise be made
available. The only restriction is that such derivative works must be
subject to the same General Public License terms as the original work.


This 3dfx GLIDE Source Code General Public License differs from the
standard licenses of this type in that it does not require the entire
derivative work to be made available under the terms of this license
nor is the recipient required to make available the source code for
the entire derivative work. Rather, the license is limited to only the
identifiable portion of the derivative work that is derived from the
licensed software. The precise terms and conditions for copying,
distribution and modification follow. 

2. DEFINITIONS

     2.1 This
License applies to any program (or other ""work"") which contains a
notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this 3dfx GLIDE Source Code General Public License.


     2.2 The term ""Program"" as used in this Agreement refers to
3DFX's GLIDE source code and object code and any Derivative Work.

   
 2.3 ""Derivative Work"" means, for the purpose of the License, that
portion of any work that contains the Program or the identifiable
portion of a work that is derived from the Program, either verbatim or
with modifications and/or translated into another language, and that
performs 3D graphics API operations. It does not include any other
portions of a work.

     2.4 ""Modifications of the Program"" means any
work, which includes a Derivative Work, and includes the whole of such
work.

     2.5 ""License"" means this 3dfx GLIDE Source Code General
Public License.

     2.6 The ""Source Code"" for a work means the
preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For an
executable work, complete source code means all the source code for
all modules it contains, any associated interface definition files,
and the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the
executable work.

     2.7 ""3dfx"" means 3dfx Interactive, Inc. 

3.
LICENSED ACTIVITIES

     3.1 COPYING - You may copy and distribute
verbatim copies of the Program's Source Code as you receive it, in any
medium, subject to the provision of section 3.3 and provided also
that:

          (a) you conspicuously and appropriately publish on
each copy an appropriate copyright notice (3dfx Interactive, Inc.
1999), a notice that recipients who wish to copy, distribute or modify
the Program can only do so subject to this License, and a disclaimer
of warranty as set forth in section 5;

          (b) keep intact all
the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
warranty; and 

          (c) do not make any use of the GLIDE
trademark without the prior written permission of 3dfx, and 

        
 (d) give all recipients of the Program a copy of this License along
with the Program or instructions on how to easily receive a copy of
this License. 

     3.2 MODIFICATION OF THE PROGRAM/DERIVATIVE WORKS
- You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of
it, and copy and distribute such modifications subject to the
provisions of section 3.3 and provided that you also meet all of the
following conditions: 

          (a) you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy of a Derivative Work an appropriate
copyright notice, a notice that recipients who wish to copy,
distribute or modify the Derivative Work can only do so subject to
this License, and a disclaimer of warranty as set forth in section
5;

          (b) keep intact all the notices that refer to this
License and to the absence of any warranty; and (c) give all
recipients of the Derivative Work a copy of this License along with
the Derivative Work or instructions on how to easily receive a copy of
this License.

          (d) You must cause the modified files of the
Derivative Work to carry prominent notices stating that you changed
the files and the date of any change. 

          (e) You must cause
any Derivative Work that you distribute or publish to be licensed at
no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License. 

    
     (f) You do not make any use of the GLIDE trademark without the
prior written permission of 3dfx. 

          (g) If the Derivative
Work normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause
it, when started running for such interactive use, to print or display
an announcement as follows:

          ""COPYRIGHT 3DFX INTERACTIVE,
INC. 1999, ALL RIGHTS RESERVED THIS SOFTWARE IS FREE AND PROVIDED ""AS

IS NO RIGHT TO USE THE GLIDE TRADEMARK WITHOUT PRIOR WRITTEN
PERMISSION OF 3DFX INTERACTIVE, INC. SEE THE 3DFX GLIDE GENERAL PUBLIC
LICENSE FOR A FULL TEXT OF THE DISTRIBUTION AND NON-WARRANTY
PROVISIONS (REQUEST COPY FROM INFO@3DFX.COM).""

          (h) The
requirements of this section 3.2 do not apply to the modified work as
a whole but only to the Derivative Work. It is not the intent of this
License to claim rights or contest your rights to work written
entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to
control the distribution of Derivative Works. 

     3.3 DISTRIBUTION


          (a) All copies of the Program or Derivative Works which
are distributed must include in the file headers the following
language verbatim:

          ""THIS SOFTWARE IS SUBJECT TO COPYRIGHT
PROTECTION AND IS OFFERED ONLY PURSUANT TO THE 3DFX GLIDE GENERAL

UNDER THE COPYRIGHT LAWS OF THE UNITED STATES.

          COPYRIGHT
3DFX INTERACTIVE, INC. 1999, ALL RIGHTS RESERVED""

          (b) You
may distribute the Program or a Derivative Work in object code or
executable form under the terms of Sections 3.1 and 3.2 provided that
you also do one of the following: 

               (1) Accompany it
with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 3.1 and 3.2; or, 
    
          
               (2) Accompany it with a written offer, valid
for at least three years, to give any third party, for a charge no
more than your cost of physically performing source distribution, a
complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
distributed under the terms of Sections 3.1 and 3.2 on a medium
customarily used for software interchange; or, 

               (3)
Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to
distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed
only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the
program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in
accord with Subsection 3.3(b)(2) above.) 

          (c) The source
code distributed need not include anything that is normally
distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
the executable code. 

          (d) If distribution of executable
code or object code is made by offering access to copy from a
designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source
code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code,
even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along
with the object code. 

          (e) Each time you redistribute the
Program or any Derivative Work, the recipient automatically receives a
license from 3dfx and successor licensors to copy, distribute or
modify the Program and Derivative Works subject to the terms and
conditions of the License. You may not impose any further restrictions
on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not
responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.


          (f) You may not make any use of the GLIDE trademark
without the prior written permission of 3dfx.

          (g) You may
not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program or any
Derivative Works except as expressly provided under this License. Any
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the
Program or any Derivative Works is void, and will automatically
terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have
received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have
their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full
compliance.

4. MISCELLANEOUS

     4.1 Acceptance of this License is
voluntary. By using, modifying or distributing the Program or any
Derivative Work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do
so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or
modifying the Program or works based on it. Nothing else grants you
permission to modify or distribute the Program or Derivative Works and
doing so without acceptance of this License is in violation of the
U.S. and international copyright laws.

     4.2 If the distribution
and/or use of the Program or Derivative Works is restricted in certain
countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original
copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an
explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those
countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

     4.3
This License is to be construed according to the laws of the State of
California and you consent to personal jurisdiction in the State of
California in the event it is necessary to enforce the provisions of
this License. 

5. NO WARRANTIES

     5.1 TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM. OR DERIVATIVE
WORKS THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM

please let us know!) 
2. You can use this software for whatever you

ansi2knr.c is included in this distribution by permission of L.
Peter Deutsch, sole proprietor of its copyright holder, Aladdin
Enterprises of Menlo Park, CA. ansi2knr.c is NOT covered by the above
copyright and conditions, but instead by the usual distribution terms
of the Free Software Foundation; principally, that you must include
source code if you redistribute it. (See the file ansi2knr.c for full
details.) However, since ansi2knr.c is not needed as part of any
program generated from the IJG code, this does not limit you more than
the foregoing paragraphs do.

The Unix configuration script
""configure"" was produced with GNU Autoconf. It is copyright by the
Free Software Foundation but is freely distributable. The same holds
for its supporting scripts (config.guess, config.sub, ltconfig,
ltmain.sh). Another support script, install-sh, is copyright by M.I.T.
but is also freely distributable.

It appears that the arithmetic
coding option of the JPEG spec is covered by patents owned by IBM,
AT&T, and Mitsubishi. Hence arithmetic coding cannot legally be used
without obtaining one or more licenses. For this reason, support for
arithmetic coding has been removed from the free JPEG software. (Since
arithmetic coding provides only a marginal gain over the unpatented
Huffman mode, it is unlikely that very many implementations will
support it.) So far as we are aware, there are no patent restrictions
on the remaining code.

The IJG distribution formerly included code to
read and write GIF files. To avoid entanglement with the Unisys LZW
patent, GIF reading support has been removed altogether, and the GIF
writer has been simplified to produce ""uncompressed GIFs"". This
technique does not use the LZW algorithm; the resulting GIF files are
larger than usual, but are readable by all standard GIF decoders.

We
are required to state that 
     ""The Graphics Interchange Format(c)
is the Copyright property of CompuServe Incorporated. GIF(sm) is a
Service Mark property of CompuServe Incorporated.""

THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED
UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS IBM
PUBLIC LICENSE (""AGREEMENT""). ANY USE,
REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION
OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S
ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.

1. DEFINITIONS
""Contribution""
means:

a.  in the case of International Business Machines Corporation
(""IBM""), the Original Program, and

b.  in the case of each
Contributor,
	i.  changes to the Program, and
	ii.  additions to the
Program;
where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate
from and
are distributed by that particular Contributor. A
Contribution
'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to the
Program by
such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such
Contributor's
behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the
Program which:
(i) are separate modules of software distributed in
conjunction with
the Program under their own license agreement, and
(ii) are not
derivative works of the Program.

""Contributor"" means IBM
and any other entity that distributes the Program.

""Licensed Patents
"" mean patent claims licensable by a
Contributor which are necessarily
infringed by the use or sale of its
Contribution alone or when
combined with the Program.

""Original Program"" means the original
version of the software
accompanying this Agreement as released by
IBM, including source
code, object code and documentation, if
any.

""Program"" means the Original Program and
Contributions.

""Recipient"" means anyone who receives the Program
under this
Agreement, including all Contributors.

2. GRANT OF
RIGHTS
a.  Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor
hereby
grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
copyright
license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly
display,
publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution
of such
Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code
and
object code form.

b.  Subject to the terms of this Agreement,
each Contributor hereby
grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide,
royalty-free patent
license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell,
offer to sell,
import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such
Contributor,
if any, in source code and object code form. This patent
license
shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the
Program
if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor,
such
addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be
covered by
the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to
any
other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware
per
se is licensed hereunder.

c.  Recipient understands that although
each Contributor grants the
licenses to its Contributions set forth
herein, no assurances are
provided by any Contributor that the Program
does not infringe the
patent or other intellectual property rights of
any other entity.
Each Contributor disclaims any liability to
Recipient for claims
brought by any other entity based on infringement
of intellectual
property rights or otherwise. As a condition to
exercising the
rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient
hereby assumes
sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual
property rights
needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent
license is
required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it
is
Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license
before
distributing the Program.

d.  Each Contributor represents that
to its knowledge it has
sufficient copyright rights in its
Contribution, if any, to grant the
copyright license set forth in this
Agreement.

3. REQUIREMENTS
A Contributor may choose to distribute
the
Program in object code form under its own license agreement,
provided
that:

a.  it complies with the terms and conditions of this
Agreement; and
b.  its license agreement:
	i.  effectively disclaims
on behalf of all Contributors all warranties
	and conditions, express
and implied, including warranties or
	conditions of title and
non-infringement, and implied warranties or
	conditions of
merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;
	ii. 
effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability
	for
damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental
and
	consequential damages, such as lost profits;
	iii.  states that
any provisions which differ from this Agreement are
	offered by that
Contributor alone and not by any other party; and
	iv.  states that
source code for the Program is available from such
	Contributor, and
informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable
	manner on or
through a medium customarily used for software exchange.

When the
Program is made available in source code form:
a.  it must be made
available under this Agreement; and
b.  a copy of this Agreement must
be included with each copy of the
Program.

Each Contributor must
include the following in a conspicuous location in the
Program:

	Copyright (C) 1996, 1999 International Business Machines
Corporation and others. All Rights Reserved.

In addition, each
Contributor must identify itself as the originator
of its
Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows
subsequent
Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.

4.
COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
Commercial distributors of software may accept
certain
responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners
and the
like. While this license is intended to facilitate the
commercial
use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the
Program in a
commercial product offering should do so in a manner
which does not
create potential liability for other Contributors.
Therefore, if a
Contributor includes the Program in a commercial
product offering,
such Contributor (""Commercial Contributor"") hereby
agrees to defend
and indemnify every other Contributor (""Indemnified
Contributor"")
against any losses, damages and costs (collectively
""Losses"") arising
from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions
brought by a third
party against the Indemnified Contributor to the
extent caused by the
acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor
in connection with
its distribution of the Program in a commercial
product offering.
The obligations in this section do not apply to any
claims or Losses
relating to any actual or alleged intellectual
property infringement.
In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor
must: a) promptly
notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such
claim, and b)
allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and
cooperate with the
Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any
related settlement
negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may
participate in any
such claim at its own expense.

For example, a
Contributor might include the Program in a commercial
product
offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a
Commercial
Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes
performance
claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those
performance
claims and warranties are such Commercial
Contributor's
responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial
Contributor
would have to defend claims against the other Contributors
related to
those performance claims and warranties, and if a court
requires any
other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the
Commercial
Contributor must pay those damages.

5. NO WARRANTY
EXCEPT
AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS
PROVIDED ON
AN ""AS IS"" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY
KIND, EITHER
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY
WARRANTIES OR
CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY
OR FITNESS FOR
A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely
responsible for
determining the appropriateness of using and
distributing the Program
and assumes all risks associated with its
exercise of rights under
this Agreement, including but not limited to
the risks and costs of
program errors, compliance with applicable
laws, damage to or loss of
data, programs or equipment, and
unavailability or interruption of
operations.

6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH
IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT
NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE
ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT,
INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,
EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES
(INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST
PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON
ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN
CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR
TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR
OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF
THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE
PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS
GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF
ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. GENERAL
If any
provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable
under
applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or
enforceability of
the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and
without further
action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be
reformed to the
minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid
and enforceable.

If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a
Contributor with
respect to a patent applicable to software (including
a cross-claim
or counterclaim in a lawsuit), then any patent licenses
granted by
that Contributor to such Recipient under this Agreement
shall
terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. In addition,
if
Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity
(including
a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
the Program
itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other
software or
hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such
Recipient's
rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of
the date such
litigation is filed.

All Recipient's rights under this
Agreement shall terminate if it
fails to comply with any of the
material terms or conditions of this
Agreement and does not cure such
failure in a reasonable period of
time after becoming aware of such
noncompliance. If all Recipient's
rights under this Agreement
terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use
and distribution of the
Program as soon as reasonably practicable.
However, Recipient's
obligations under this Agreement and any
licenses granted by Recipient
relating to the Program shall continue
and survive.

IBM may publish
new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement
from time to
time. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a
distinguishing
version number. The Program (including Contributions)
may always be
distributed subject to the version of the Agreement
under which it was
received. In addition, after a new version of the
Agreement is
published, Contributor may elect to distribute the
Program (including
its Contributions) under the new version. No one
other than IBM has
the right to modify this Agreement. Except as
expressly stated in
Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives
no rights or licenses
to the intellectual property of any Contributor
under this Agreement,
whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or
otherwise. All rights
in the Program not expressly granted under
this Agreement are
reserved.

This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New
York and
the intellectual property laws of the United States of
America. No
party to this Agreement will bring a legal action under
this
Agreement more than one year after the cause of action arose.
Each
party waives its rights to a jury trial in any resulting
litigation.

Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation
against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a
lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within

any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work
shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as
an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such
additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the
License. 

You may add Your own copyright statement to Your
modifications and may provide additional or different license terms
and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your
modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided
Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise
complies with the conditions stated in this License.

5. Submission of
Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution
intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the
Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License,

grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor
be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work
(including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work
stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other
commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been
advised of the possibility of such damages.

9. Accepting Warranty or
Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative
Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for,
acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability
obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in
accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on
Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and
only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor
harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against,
such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or
additional liability.

[ Copyleft Attitude ]

Version 1.2

Préambule
:

Avec cette Licence Art Libre, l’autorisation est donnée de
copier, de diffuser et de transformer librement les oeuvres dans le
respect des droits de l’auteur.

Loin d’ignorer les droits de
l’auteur, cette licence les reconnaît et les protège. Elle en
reformule le principe en permettant au public de faire un usage
créatif des oeuvres d’art. 

Alors que l’usage fait du droit de
la propriété littéraire et artistique conduit à restreindre
l’accès du public à l’oeuvre, la Licence Art Libre a pour but de
le favoriser. 

L’intention est d’ouvrir l’accès et
d’autoriser l’utilisation des ressources d’une oeuvre par le
plus grand nombre. En avoir jouissance pour en multiplier les
réjouissances, créer de nouvelles conditions de création pour
amplifier les possibilités de création. Dans le respect des auteurs
avec la reconnaissance et la défense de leur droit moral.

En effet,
avec la venue du numérique, l’invention de l’internet et des
logiciels libres, un nouveau mode de création et de production est
apparu. Il est aussi l’amplification de ce qui a été expérimenté
par nombre d’artistes contemporains.
Le savoir et la création sont
des ressources qui doivent demeurer libres pour être encore
véritablement du savoir et de la création. C’est à dire rester
une recherche fondamentale qui ne soit pas directement liée à une
application concrète. Créer c’est découvrir l’inconnu, c’est
inventer le réel avant tout souci de réalisme. 

Ainsi, l’objet
de l’art n’est pas confondu avec l’objet d’art fini et défini
comme tel. 
C’est la raison essentielle de cette Licence Art Libre
: promouvoir et protéger des pratiques artistiques libérées des
seules règles de l’économie de marché.

DÉFINITIONS

–
L’oeuvre : 
il s’agit d’une oeuvre commune qui comprend
l’oeuvre originelle ainsi que toutes les contributions postérieures
(les originaux conséquents et les copies). Elle est créée à
l’initiative de l’auteur originel qui par cette licence définit
les conditions selon lesquelles les contributions sont faites.

–
L’oeuvre originelle :

Préambule :

Avec la Licence Art
Libre, l’autorisation est donnée de copier, de diffuser et de
transformer librement les œuvres dans le respect des droits de
l’auteur.

Loin d’ignorer ces droits, la Licence Art Libre les
reconnaît et les protège. Elle en reformule l’exercice en
permettant à tout un chacun de faire un usage créatif des
productions de l’esprit quels que soient leur genre et leur forme
d’expression.

Si, en règle générale, l’application du droit
d’auteur conduit à restreindre l’accès aux œuvres de
l’esprit, la Licence Art Libre, au contraire, le favorise.
L’intention est d’autoriser l’utilisation des ressources d’une
œuvre ; créer de nouvelles conditions de création pour amplifier
les possibilités de création. La Licence Art Libre permet d’avoir
jouissance des œuvres tout en reconnaissant les droits et les
responsabilités de chacun.

Avec le développement du numérique,
l’invention d’internet et des logiciels libres, les modalités de
création ont évolué : les productions de l’esprit s’offrent
naturellement à la circulation, à l’échange et aux
transformations. Elles se prêtent favorablement à la réalisation
d’œuvres communes que chacun peut augmenter pour l’avantage de
tous.

C’est la raison essentielle de la Licence Art Libre :
promouvoir et protéger ces productions de l’esprit selon les
principes du copyleft : liberté d’usage, de copie, de diffusion, de
transformation et interdiction d’appropriation
exclusive.

Définitions :

Nous désignons par « œuvre », autant
l’œuvre initiale, les œuvres conséquentes, que l’œuvre commune
telles que définies ci-après :

L’œuvre commune : 
Il s’agit
d’une œuvre qui comprend l’œuvre initiale ainsi que toutes les
contributions postérieures (les originaux conséquents et les
copies). Elle est créée à l’initiative de l’auteur initial qui
par cette licence définit les conditions selon lesquelles les
contributions sont faites.

L’œuvre initiale : 
C’est-à-dire
l’œuvre créée par l’initiateur de l’œuvre commune dont les
copies vont être modifiées par qui le souhaite.

Les œuvres
conséquentes : 
C’est-à-dire les contributions des auteurs qui
participent à la formation de l’œuvre commune en faisant usage des
droits de reproduction, de diffusion et de modification que leur
confère la licence.

Originaux (sources ou ressources de l’œuvre)
: 
Chaque exemplaire daté de l’œuvre initiale ou conséquente que
leurs auteurs présentent comme référence pour toutes
actualisations, interprétations, copies ou reproductions
ultérieures.

Copie : 
Toute reproduction d’un original au sens de
cette licence.

1- OBJET.
Cette licence a pour objet de définir les
conditions selon lesquelles vous pouvez jouir librement de
l’œuvre.

2. L’ÉTENDUE DE LA JOUISSANCE.

3. DROITS CONNEXES.
Les actes donnant lieu
à des droits d’auteur ou des droits voisins ne doivent pas
constituer un obstacle aux libertés conférées par cette
licence. 
C’est pourquoi, par exemple, les interprétations doivent
être soumises à la même licence ou une licence compatible. De
même, l’intégration de l’œuvre à une base de données, une

l’œuvre, y compris à des fins lucratives, et sans autres
restrictions que celles qu’impose le respect des autres critères de
compatibilité ;
     2.	elle garantit la paternité de l’œuvre et
l’accès aux versions antérieures de l’œuvre quand cet accès
est possible ;
     3.	elle reconnaît la LAL également compatible
(réciprocité) ;
     4.	elle impose que les modifications faites sur
l’œuvre soient soumises à la même licence ou encore à une
licence répondant aux critères de compatibilité posés par la
LAL.

vos droits d’auteur sur votre contribution ni vos droits connexes.
En choisissant de contribuer à l’évolution de cette œuvre
commune, vous acceptez seulement d’offrir aux autres les mêmes
autorisations sur votre contribution que celles qui vous ont été
accordées par cette licence. Ces autorisations n’entraînent pas un
dessaisissement de vos droits intellectuels.

7. VOS
RESPONSABILITÉS.
La liberté de jouir de l’œuvre tel que permis
par la LAL (liberté de copier, diffuser, modifier) implique pour
chacun la responsabilité de ses propres faits.

Cette licence prend effet dès votre acceptation de ses
dispositions. Le fait de copier, de diffuser, ou de modifier
l’œuvre constitue une acceptation tacite. 

Cette licence a pour

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software
Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
 
Everyone is permitted to copy and
distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it
is not allowed.

This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License
incorporates the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General
Public License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed
below.

0. Additional Definitions.

As used herein, ""this License""
refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser General Public License, and the
""GNU GPL"" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

""The
Library"" refers to a covered work governed by this License, other than
an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.

An ""Application""
is any work that makes use of an interface provided by the Library,
but which is not otherwise based on the Library. Defining a subclass
of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode of using an
interface provided by the Library.

A ""Combined Work"" is a work
produced by combining or linking an Application with the Library.  The
particular version of the Library with which the Combined Work was
made is also called the ""Linked Version"".

The ""Minimal Corresponding
Source"" for a Combined Work means the Corresponding Source for the
Combined Work, excluding any source code for portions of the Combined
Work that, considered in isolation, are based on the Application, and
not on the Linked Version.

The ""Corresponding Application Code"" for a
Combined Work means the object code and/or source code for the
Application, including any data and utility programs needed for
reproducing the Combined Work from the Application, but excluding the
System Libraries of the Combined Work.

1. Exception to Section 3 of
the GNU GPL.
You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of
this License without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.

2.
Conveying Modified Versions.
If you modify a copy of the Library, and,
in your modifications, a facility refers to a function or data to be
supplied by an Application that uses the facility (other than as an
argument passed when the facility is invoked), then you may convey a
copy of the modified version:

   a) under this License, provided that
you make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an
Application does not supply the function or data, the facility still
operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains
meaningful, or

   b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional
permissions of this License applicable to that copy.

3. Object Code
Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.
The object code form
of an Application may incorporate material from a header file that is
part of the Library.  You may convey such object code under terms of
your choice, provided that, if the incorporated material is not
limited to numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors,
or small macros, inline functions and templates (ten or fewer lines in
length), you do both of the following:

   a) Give prominent notice
with each copy of the object code that the Library is used in it and
that the Library and its use are covered by this License.

   b)
Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
document.

4. Combined Works.
You may convey a Combined Work under
terms of your choice that, taken together, effectively do not restrict
modification of the portions of the Library contained in the Combined
Work and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications, if you
also do each of the following:

   a) Give prominent notice with each
copy of the Combined Work that the Library is used in it and that the
Library and its use are covered by this License.

   b) Accompany the
Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document.

 
 c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during
execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among these
notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the copies of
the GNU GPL and this license document.

   d) Do one of the
following:

       0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under
the terms of this License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a
form suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to recombine
or relink the Application with a modified version of the Linked
Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the manner specified
by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.

     
 1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time a copy
of the Library already present on the user's computer system, and (b)
will operate properly with a modified version of the Library that is
interface-compatible with the Linked Version.

   e) Provide
Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise be required
to provide such information under section 6 of the GNU GPL, and only
to the extent that such information is necessary to install and
execute a modified version of the Combined Work produced by
recombining or relinking the Application with a modified version of
the Linked Version. (If you use option 4d0, the Installation
Information must accompany the Minimal Corresponding Source and
Corresponding Application Code. If you use option 4d1, you must
provide the Installation Information in the manner specified by
section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.)

5.
Combined Libraries.
You may place library facilities that are a work
based on the Library side by side in a single library together with
other library facilities that are not Applications and are not covered
by this License, and convey such a combined library under terms of
your choice, if you do both of the following:

   a) Accompany the
combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library,
uncombined with any other library facilities, conveyed under the terms
of this License.

   b) Give prominent notice with the combined
library that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

6.
Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.
The Free
Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU
Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions
will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in
detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a
distinguishing version number. If the Library as you received it
specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Lesser General
Public License ""or any later version"" applies to it, you have the
option of following the terms and conditions either of that published
version or of any later version published by the Free Software
Foundation. If the Library as you received it does not specify a
version number of the GNU Lesser General Public License, you may
choose any version of the GNU Lesser General Public License ever
published by the Free Software Foundation.

If the Library as you
received it specifies that a proxy can decide whether future versions
of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall
apply, that proxy's
public statement of acceptance of any version is permanent
authorization for you to choose that version for the Library.

without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.

2. Conveying
Modified Versions.
If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your
modifications, a facility refers to a function or data to be supplied

you do both of the following:

     a) Give prominent notice with each

Source and Corresponding Application Code. If you use option 4d1, you
must provide the Installation Information in the manner specified by
section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.)

5.
Combined Libraries.
You may place library facilities that are a work
based on the Library side by side in a single library together with
other library facilities that are not Applications and are not covered
by this License, and convey such a combined library under terms of
your choice, if you do both of the following:

     a) Accompany the
combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library,
uncombined with any other library facilities, conveyed under the terms
of this License.

     b) Give prominent notice with the combined
library that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

6.
Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.
The Free
Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU
Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions
will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in
detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a
distinguishing version number. If the Library as you received it
specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Lesser General
Public License ""or any later version"" applies to it, you have the
option of following the terms and conditions either of that published
version or of any later version published by the Free Software
Foundation. If the Library as you received it does not specify a
version number of the GNU Lesser General Public License, you may
choose any version of the GNU Lesser General Public License ever
published by the Free Software Foundation.

If the Library as you
received it specifies that a proxy can decide whether future versions
of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall
apply, that proxy's
public statement of acceptance of any version is permanent
authorization for you to choose that version for the Library.

Preamble

The
licenses for most data are designed to take away your freedom to share
and change it. By contrast, this License is intended to guarantee your
freedom to share and change free data--to make sure the data are free
for all their users.

This License, the Lesser General Public License
for Linguistic Resources, applies to some specially designated
linguistic resources -- typically lexicons and grammars. 

TERMS AND
CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

0. This License
Agreement applies to any Linguistic Resource which contains a notice
placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may
be distributed under the terms of this Lesser General Public License
for Linguistic Resources (also called ""this License""). Each licensee
is addressed as ""you"".

A ""linguistic resource"" means a collection of
data about language prepared so as to be used with application
programs.

The ""Linguistic Resource"", below, refers to any such work
which has been distributed under these terms. A ""work based on the
Linguistic Resource"" means either the Linguistic Resource or any
derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing
the Linguistic Resource or a portion of it, either verbatim or with
modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into another
language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term ""modification"".)

""Legible form"" for a linguistic resource
means the preferred form of the resource for making modifications to
it.

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are
not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of
running a program using the Linguistic Resource is not restricted, and
output from such a program is covered only if its contents constitute
a work based on the Linguistic Resource (independent of the use of the
Linguistic Resource in a tool for writing it). Whether that is true
depends on what the program that uses the Linguistic Resource
does.

1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the
Linguistic Resource as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
Linguistic Resource.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of
transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty
protection in exchange for a fee.

2. You may modify your copy or
copies of the Linguistic Resource or any portion of it, thus forming a
work based on the Linguistic Resource, and copy and distribute such
modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided
that you also meet all of these conditions:

     a) The modified work
must itself be a linguistic resource. 

     b) You must cause the
files modified to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the
files and the date of any change. 

     c) You must cause the whole
of the work to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under the
terms of this License.

These requirements apply to the modified work
as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from
the Linguistic Resource, and can be reasonably considered independent
and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do
not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate
works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole
which is a work based on the Linguistic Resource, the distribution of
the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for
other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every
part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this
section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written
entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to
control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on
the Linguistic Resource.

In addition, mere aggregation of another
work not based on the Linguistic Resource with the Linguistic Resource
(or with a work based on the Linguistic Resource) on a volume of a
storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the
scope of this License.

3. A program that contains no derivative of
any portion of the Linguistic Resource, but is designed to work with
the Linguistic Resource (or an encrypted form of the Linguistic
Resource) by reading it or being compiled or linked with it, is called
a ""work that uses the Linguistic Resource"". Such a work, in isolation,
is not a derivative work of the Linguistic Resource, and therefore
falls outside the scope of this License.

However, combining a ""work
that uses the Linguistic Resource"" with the Linguistic Resource (or an
encrypted form of the Linguistic Resource) creates a package that is a
derivative of the Linguistic Resource (because it contains portions of
the Linguistic Resource), rather than a ""work that uses the Linguistic
Resource"". If the package is a derivative of the Linguistic Resource,
you may distribute the package under the terms of Section 4. Any works
containing that package also fall under Section 4.

4. As an exception
to the Sections above, you may also combine a ""work that uses the
Linguistic Resource"" with the Linguistic Resource (or an encrypted
form of the Linguistic Resource) to produce a package containing
portions of the Linguistic Resource, and distribute that package under
terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit modification of
the package for the customer's own use and reverse engineering for
debugging such modifications.

You must give prominent notice with
each copy of the package that the Linguistic Resource is used in it
and that the Linguistic Resource and its use are covered by this
License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the package during
execution displays copyright notices, you must include the copyright
notice for the Linguistic Resource among them, as well as a reference
directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one
of these things:

     a) Accompany the package with the complete
corresponding machine-readable legible form of the Linguistic Resource
including whatever changes were used in the package (which must be
distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the package
contains an encrypted form of the Linguistic Resource, with the
complete machine-readable ""work that uses the Linguistic Resource"", as
object code and/or source code, so that the user can modify the
Linguistic Resource and then encrypt it to produce a modified package
containing the modified Linguistic Resource. 

     b) Use a suitable
mechanism for combining with the Linguistic Resource. A suitable
mechanism is one that will operate properly with a modified version of
the Linguistic Resource, if the user installs one, as long as the
modified version is interface-compatible with the version that the
package was made with. 

     c) Accompany the package with a written
offer, valid for at least three years, to give the same user the
materials specified in Subsection 4a, above, for a charge no more than
the cost of performing this distribution. 

     d) If distribution of
the package is made by offering access to copy from a designated
place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified materials
from the same place. 

     e) Verify that the user has already
received a copy of these materials or that you have already sent this
user a copy.

If the package includes an encrypted form of the
Linguistic Resource, the required form of the ""work that uses the
Linguistic Resource"" must include any data and utility programs needed
for reproducing the package from it. However, as a special exception,
the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
the executable.

It may happen that this requirement contradicts the
license restrictions of proprietary libraries that do not normally
accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot
use both them and the Linguistic Resource together in a package that
you distribute.

5. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with,
or distribute the Linguistic Resource except as expressly provided
under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense,
link with, or distribute the Linguistic Resource is void, and will
automatically terminate your rights under this License. However,
parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this
License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

6. You are not required to accept
this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else
grants you permission to modify or distribute the Linguistic Resource
or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do
not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the
Linguistic Resource (or any work based on the Linguistic Resource),
you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its
terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the
Linguistic Resource or works based on it.

7. Each time you
redistribute the Linguistic Resource (or any work based on the
Linguistic Resource), the recipient automatically receives a license
from the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify
the Linguistic Resource subject to these terms and conditions. You may
not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the
rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing
compliance by third parties with this License.

8. If, as a
consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement
or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are
imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that
contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from
the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to
satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any
other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not
distribute the Linguistic Resource at all. For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Linguistic
Resource by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly
through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this
License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the
Linguistic Resource.

If any portion of this section is held invalid
or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the
section is intended to apply, and the section as a whole is intended
to apply in other circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this
section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right
claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the
sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free resource
distribution system which is implemented by public license practices.
Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of data
distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application
of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is
willing to distribute resources through any other system and a
licensee cannot impose that choice.

This section is intended to make
thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of
this License.

9. If the distribution and/or use of the Linguistic
Resource is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by
copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the
Linguistic Resource under this License may add an explicit
geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so
that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
written in the body of this License.

10. The Free Software Foundation
may publish revised and/or new versions of the Lesser General Public
License for Linguistic Resources from time to time. Such new versions
will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in
detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a
distinguishing version number. If the Linguistic Resource specifies a
version number of this License which applies to it and ""any later
version"", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation. If the Linguistic Resource does not specify a
license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
the Free Software Foundation.

11. If you wish to incorporate parts of
the Linguistic Resource into other free programs whose distribution
conditions are incompatible with these, write to the author to ask for
permission. 

 NO WARRANTY

12. BECAUSE THE LINGUISTIC RESOURCE IS
LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE LINGUISTIC
RESOURCE, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE LINGUISTIC RESOURCE ""AS IS"" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
LINGUISTIC RESOURCE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LINGUISTIC RESOURCE PROVE
DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR
CORRECTION.

13. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR
AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO
MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LINGUISTIC RESOURCE AS PERMITTED
ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL,
INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR
INABILITY TO USE THE LINGUISTIC RESOURCE (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LINGUISTIC RESOURCE TO
OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY
HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS
PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE (""AGREEMENT""). ANY
USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES
RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.

1.
DEFINITIONS

""Contribution"" means:

     a.  in the case of
<ORGANIZATION> (""<OWNER>""), the Original Program, and
     b.  in the
case of each Contributor,

          i.  changes to the Program, and
 
        ii.  additions to the Program; where such changes and/or
additions to the Program originate from and are ""Contributed"" by that
particular Contributor.

          A Contribution is ""Contributed"" by
a Contributor only (i) if it was added to the Program by such
Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf, and
(ii) the Contributor explicitly consents, in accordance with Section
3C, to characterization of the changes and/or additions as
Contributions. Contributions do not include additions to the Program
which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in conjunction
with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not
derivative works of the Program.

""Contributor"" means <OWNER> and any
other entity that has Contributed a Contribution to the
Program.

""Distributor"" means a Recipient that distributes the
Program, modifications to the Program, or any part thereof.

""Licensed
Patents"" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are
necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or
when combined with the Program.

""Original Program"" means the original
version of the software accompanying this Agreement as released by
<OWNER>, including source code, object code and documentation, if
any.

""Program"" means the Original Program and Contributions or any
part thereof

""Recipient"" means anyone who receives the Program under
this Agreement, including all Contributors.

2. GRANT OF RIGHTS

    
a. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright
license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display,
publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such
Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and
object code form.

     b. Subject to the terms of this Agreement,
each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide,
royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell,
offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such
Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. The patent
license granted by a Contributor shall also apply to the combination
of the Contribution of that Contributor and the Program if, at the
time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of
the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed
Patents. The patent license granted by a Contributor shall not apply
to (i) any other combinations which include the Contribution, nor to
(ii) Contributions of other Contributors. No hardware per se is
licensed hereunder.

     c.  Recipient understands that although each
Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein,
no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does
not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any
other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient
for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of
intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to
exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient
hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual
property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent
license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it
is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before
distributing the Program.

     d.  Each Contributor represents that
to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright rights in its
Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in this
Agreement.

3. REQUIREMENTS

     A. Distributor may choose to
distribute the Program in any form under this Agreement or under its
own license agreement, provided that:

          1.  it complies with
the terms and conditions of this Agreement;
          2.  if the
Program is distributed in source code or other tangible form, a copy
of this Agreement or Distributor's own license agreement is included
with each copy of the Program; and
          3.  if distributed under
Distributor's own license agreement, such license agreement:

        
      a.  effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all
warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties
or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or
conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;
  
            b.  effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all
liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental
and consequential damages, such as lost profits; and
               c.
 states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are
offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party.

     B.
Each Distributor must include the following in a conspicuous location
in the Program:

     Copyright (C) <YEAR>, <ORGANIZATION> and others.
All Rights Reserved.

     C. In addition, each Contributor must
identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if any, and
indicate its consent to characterization of its additions and/or
changes as a Contribution, in a manner that reasonably allows
subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.
Once consent is granted, it may not thereafter be revoked.

4.
COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION

Commercial distributors of software may
accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business
partners and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate
the commercial use of the Program, the Distributor who includes the
Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner
which does not create potential liability for Contributors. Therefore,
if a Distributor includes the Program in a commercial product
offering, such Distributor (""Commercial Distributor"") hereby agrees to
defend and indemnify every Contributor (""Indemnified Contributor"")
against any losses, damages and costs (collectively ""Losses"") arising
from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party
against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts
or omissions of such Commercial Distributor in connection with its
distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The
obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses
relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement.
In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly
notify the Commercial Distributor in writing of such claim, and b)
allow the Commercial Distributor to control, and cooperate with the
Commercial Distributor in, the defense and any related settlement
negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such
claim at its own expense.

For example, a Distributor might include
the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That
Distributor is then a Commercial Distributor. If that Commercial
Distributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties
related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such
Commercial Distributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the
Commercial Distributor would have to defend claims against the
Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and
if a court requires any Contributor to pay any damages as a result,
the Commercial Distributor must pay those damages.

5. NO
WARRANTY

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM
IS PROVIDED ON AN ""AS IS"" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF
ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY
WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY
OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely
responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and
distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its
exercise of rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to
the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable
laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and
unavailability or interruption of operations.

6. DISCLAIMER OF
LIABILITY

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER
RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY
DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL
DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED
AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY,
OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF
THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS
GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES.

7. GENERAL

If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or
unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity
or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and
without further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be
reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid
and enforceable.

If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a
Contributor with respect to a patent applicable to software (including
a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit), then any patent licenses
granted by that Contributor to such Recipient under this Agreement
shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. In addition,
if Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other
software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such
Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of
the date such litigation is filed.

All Recipient's rights under this
Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the
material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such
failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such
noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement
terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the
Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's
obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient
relating to the Program shall continue and survive.

<OWNER> may
publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time
to time. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a
distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions)
may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement
under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the
Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the
Program (including its Contributions) under the new version. No one
other than <OWNER> has the right to modify this Agreement. Except as
expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives
no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor
under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or
otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this
Agreement are reserved.

This Agreement is governed by the laws of the
State of <STATE> and the intellectual property laws of the United
States of America. No party to this Agreement will bring a legal
action under this Agreement more than one year after the cause of
action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in any
resulting litigation.

Also, each Contributor must agree that the additions and/or changes
are intended to be a Contribution. Once a Contribution is contributed,
it may not thereafter be revoked.

4. COMMERCIAL
DISTRIBUTION

Commercial distributors of software may accept certain
responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the
like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use
of the Program, the Distributor who includes the Program in a
commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not
create potential liability for Contributors. Therefore, if a
Distributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering,
such Distributor (""Commercial Distributor"") hereby agrees to defend
and indemnify every Contributor (""Indemnified Contributor"") against
any losses, damages and costs (collectively ""Losses"") arising from
claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party
against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts
or omissions of such Commercial Distributor in connection with its
distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The
obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses
relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement.
In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly
notify the Commercial Distributor in writing of such claim, and b)
allow the Commercial Distributor to control, and cooperate with the
Commercial Distributor in, the defense and any related settlement
negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such
claim at its own expense.

For example, a Distributor might include
the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That
Distributor is then a Commercial Distributor. If that Commercial
Distributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties
related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such
Commercial Distributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the
Commercial Distributor would have to defend claims against the
Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and
if a court requires any Contributor to pay any damages as a result,
the Commercial Distributor must pay those damages.

5. NO
WARRANTY

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM
IS PROVIDED ON AN ""AS IS"" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF
ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY
WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY
OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely
responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and
distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its
exercise of rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to
the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable
laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and
unavailability or interruption of operations.

6. DISCLAIMER OF
LIABILITY

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER
RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY
DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL
DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED
AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY,
OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF
THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS
GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES.

7. EXPORT CONTROL

Recipient agrees that Recipient alone is
responsible for compliance with the United States export
administration regulations (and the export control laws and regulation
of any other countries).

8. GENERAL

If any provision of this
Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall
not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the
terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties
hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent
necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.

If Recipient
institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with respect to a
patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or counterclaim
in a lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that Contributor to
such Recipient under this Agreement shall terminate as of the date
such litigation is filed. In addition, if Recipient institutes patent
litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim
in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations
of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes such
Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under
Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is
filed.

All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if
it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of
this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period
of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's
rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use
and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable.
However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses
granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and
survive.

LUCENT may publish new versions (including revisions) of
this Agreement from time to time. Each new version of the Agreement
will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including
Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the
Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new
version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to
distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new
version. No one other than LUCENT has the right to modify this
Agreement. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above,
Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property
of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by
implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not
expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.

This Agreement
is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the intellectual
property laws of the United States of America. No party to this
Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one
year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to
a jury trial in any resulting litigation.

ou encore tout nouveau fichier source qui incorpore le logiciel ou une
partie importante de ce dernier.

3. Licence de droit d'auteur
Sous
réserve des termes de la licence, le concédant accorde au licencié
une licence non exclusive et libre de redevances lui permettant
d’exercer les droits suivants sur le logiciel :

     1 Produire
ou reproduire la totalité ou une partie importante;
     2 Exécuter
ou représenter la totalité ou une partie importante en public;
    
3 Publier la totalité ou une partie importante;
    
4 Sous-licencier sous une autre licence libre, approuvée ou

sans limite de temps.

L'exercice complet de ces droits est sujet à
la distribution par le concédant du code source du logiciel, lequel
doit être sous une forme permettant d'y apporter des modifications.
Le concédant peut aussi distribuer le logiciel accompagné d'une
offre de distribuer le code source du logiciel, sans frais
supplémentaires, autres que ceux raisonnables afin de permettre la
livraison du code source. Cette offre doit être valide pendant une
durée raisonnable.

4. Distribution
Le licencié peut distribuer des
copies du logiciel, d'un logiciel modifié ou dérivé, sous réserve
de respecter les conditions suivantes :

     1 Le logiciel doit
être accompagné d'un exemplaire de cette licence;
     2 Si le
logiciel a été modifié, le licencié doit en faire la mention, de
préférence dans chacun des fichiers modifiés dont la nature permet
une telle mention;
     3 Les étiquettes ou mentions faisant état
des droits d'auteur, des marques de commerce, des garanties ou de la
paternité concernant le logiciel ne doivent pas être modifiées ou
supprimées, à moins que ces étiquettes ou mentions ne soient
inapplicables à un logiciel modifié ou dérivé donné.

5.
Contributions
Sous réserve d'une entente distincte, toute
contribution soumise par un contributeur au concédant pour inclusion
dans le logiciel sera soumise aux termes de cette licence.

6. Marques
de commerce
La licence n'accorde aucune permission particulière qui
permettrait d'utiliser les marques de commerce du concédant, autre
que celle requise permettant d'identifier la provenance du
logiciel.

7. Garanties
Sauf mention contraire, le concédant
distribue le logiciel sans aucune garantie, aux risques et périls de
l'acquéreur de la copie du logiciel, et ce, sans assurer que le
logiciel puisse répondre à un besoin particulier ou puisse donner un
résultat quelconque. 

Sans lier le concédant d'une quelconque
manière, rien n'empêche un licencié d'offrir ou d'exclure des
garanties ou du support.

8. Responsabilité
Le licencié est
responsable de tout préjudice résultant de l'exercice des droits
accordés par la licence. 

Le concédant ne saurait être tenu
responsable de dommages subis par le licencié ou par des tiers, pour
quelque cause que ce soit en lien avec la licence et les droits qui y
sont accordés.

9. Résiliation
La présente licence est
automatiquement résiliée dès que les droits qui y sont accordés ne
sont pas exercés conformément aux termes qui y sont
stipulés.

Toutefois, si le défaut est corrigé dans un délai de 30
jours de sa prise de connaissance par la personne en défaut, et qu'il
s'agit du premier défaut, la licence est accordée de nouveau.

Pour
tout défaut subséquent, le consentement exprès du concédant est
nécessaire afin que la licence soit accordée de nouveau.

10.
Version de la licence
Le Centre de services partagés du Québec, ses
ayants cause ou toute personne qu'il désigne, peuvent diffuser des
versions révisées ou modifiées de cette licence. Chaque version
recevra un numéro unique. Si un logiciel est déjà soumis aux termes
d'une version spécifique, c'est seulement cette version qui liera les
parties à la licence.

Le concédant peut aussi choisir de concéder
la licence sous la version actuelle ou toute version ultérieure,
auquel cas le licencié peut choisir sous quelle version la licence
lui est accordée.

11. Divers
Dans la mesure où le concédant est un
ministère, un organisme public ou une personne morale de droit
public, créés en vertu d'une loi de l'Assemblée nationale du
Québec, la licence est régie par le droit applicable au Québec et
en cas de contestation, les tribunaux du Québec seront seuls
compétents.

La présente licence peut être distribuée sans
conditions particulières. Toutefois, une version modifiée doit être
distribuée sous un nom différent. Toute référence au Centre de
services partagés du Québec, et, le cas échéant, ses ayant cause,
doit être retirée, autre que celle permettant d'identifier la
provenance de la licence.

et libre de redevances lui permettant d’exercer les droits suivants
sur le logiciel :

     1 Produire ou reproduire la totalité ou une
partie importante;
     2 Exécuter ou représenter la totalité ou
une partie importante en public;
     3 Publier la totalité ou une

être accompagné d'un exemplaire de cette licence;
     2 Si le

4.1.
Réciprocité
Chaque fois que le licencié distribue le logiciel, le
concédant offre au récipiendaire une concession sur le logiciel
selon les termes de la présente licence. Le licencié doit offrir une
concession selon les termes de la présente licence pour tout logiciel
modifié qu'il distribue.

Chaque fois que le licencié distribue le
logiciel ou un logiciel modifié, ce dernier doit assumer l'obligation
d'en distribuer le code source, de la manière prévue au troisième
alinéa de l'article 3.

4.2. Compatibilité
Dans la mesure où le
licencié souhaite distribuer un logiciel modifié combiné à un
logiciel assujetti à une licence compatible, mais dont il ne serait
pas possible d'en respecter les termes, le concédant offre, en plus
de la présente concession, une concession selon les termes de cette
licence compatible.

Un licencié qui est titulaire exclusif du droit
d'auteur sur le logiciel assujetti à une licence compatible ne peut
pas se prévaloir de cette offre. Il en est de même pour toute autre
personne dûment autorisée à sous-licencier par le titulaire
exclusif du droit d'auteur sur le logiciel assujetti à une licence
compatible.

Est considérée comme une licence compatible toute
licence libre approuvée ou certifiée par la Free Software Foundation
ou l'Open Source Initiative, dont le niveau de réciprocité est
comparable ou supérieur à celui de la présente licence, sans
toutefois être moindre, notamment :

incorporé dans le logiciel;
     « distribution » : le fait de
délivrer une copie du logiciel;
     « licencié » : toute
personne qui possède une copie du logiciel et qui exerce les droits
concédés par la licence;
     « logiciel » : une œuvre
protégée par le droit d'auteur, telle qu'un programme d'ordinateur
et sa documentation, pour laquelle le titulaire du droit d'auteur a
précisé qu'elle est sujette aux termes de la présente licence;
    
« logiciel dérivé » : tout logiciel original réalisé par un
licencié, autre que le logiciel ou un logiciel modifié, qui produit
ou reproduit la totalité ou une partie importante du logiciel;
    
« logiciel modifié » : toute modification par un licencié de
l'un des fichiers source du logiciel ou encore tout nouveau fichier
source qui incorpore le logiciel ou une partie importante de ce
dernier.

3. Licence de droit d'auteur
Sous réserve des termes de la
licence, le concédant accorde au licencié une licence non exclusive
et libre de redevances lui permettant d’exercer les droits suivants
sur le logiciel :

     1 Produire ou reproduire la totalité ou une
partie importante;
     2 Exécuter ou représenter la totalité ou
une partie importante en public;
     3 Publier la totalité ou une
partie importante.

Cette licence est accordée sans limite
territoriale et sans limite de temps.

L'exercice complet de ces
droits est sujet à la distribution par le concédant du code source
du logiciel, lequel doit être sous une forme permettant d'y apporter
des modifications. Le concédant peut aussi distribuer le logiciel
accompagné d'une offre de distribuer le code source du logiciel, sans
frais supplémentaires, autres que ceux raisonnables afin de permettre
la livraison du code source. Cette offre doit être valide pendant une
durée raisonnable.

4. Distribution
Le licencié peut distribuer des
copies du logiciel, d'un logiciel modifié ou dérivé, sous réserve
de respecter les conditions suivantes :

     1 Le logiciel doit
être accompagné d'un exemplaire de cette licence;
     2 Si le
logiciel a été modifié, le licencié doit en faire la mention, de
préférence dans chacun des fichiers modifiés dont la nature permet
une telle mention;
     3 Les étiquettes ou mentions faisant état
des droits d'auteur, des marques de commerce, des garanties ou de la
paternité concernant le logiciel ne doivent pas être modifiées ou
supprimées, à moins que ces étiquettes ou mentions ne soient
inapplicables à un logiciel modifié ou dérivé donné.

4.1.
Réciprocité
Chaque fois que le licencié distribue le logiciel, le
concédant offre au récipiendaire une concession sur le logiciel
selon les termes de la présente licence. Le licencié doit offrir une
concession selon les termes de la présente licence pour tout logiciel
modifié ou dérivé qu'il distribue.

Chaque fois que le licencié
distribue le logiciel, un logiciel modifié, ou un logiciel dérivé,
ce dernier doit assumer l'obligation d'en distribuer le code source,
de la manière prévue au troisième alinéa de l'article 3.

4.2.
Compatibilité
Dans la mesure où le licencié souhaite distribuer un
logiciel modifié ou dérivé combiné à un logiciel assujetti à une
licence compatible, mais dont il ne serait pas possible d'en respecter
les termes, le concédant offre, en plus de la présente concession,
une concession selon les termes de cette licence compatible.

Un
licencié qui est titulaire exclusif du droit d'auteur sur le logiciel
assujetti à une licence compatible ne peut pas se prévaloir de cette
offre. Il en est de même pour toute autre personne dûment autorisée
à sous-licencier par le titulaire exclusif du droit d'auteur sur le
logiciel assujetti à une licence compatible.

Est considérée comme
une licence compatible toute licence libre approuvée ou certifiée
par la Free Software Foundation ou l'Open Source Initiative, dont le
niveau de réciprocité est comparable à celui de la présente
licence, sans toutefois être moindre, notamment :

     1 Common
Public License Version 1.0 (CPL-1.0)
     2 Contrat de licence de
logiciel libre CeCILL, version 2.1 (CECILL-2.1)
     3 Eclipse Public
License - v 1.0 (EPL-1.0)
     4 European Union Public License,
version 1.1 (EUPL v. 1.1)
     5 GNU General Public License Version 2
(GNU GPLv2)
     6 GNU General Public License Version 3 (GNU
GPLv3)

5. Contributions
Sous réserve d'une entente distincte, toute
contribution soumise par un contributeur au concédant pour inclusion
dans le logiciel sera soumise aux termes de cette licence.

6. Marques
de commerce
La licence n'accorde aucune permission particulière qui
permettrait d'utiliser les marques de commerce du concédant, autre
que celle requise permettant d'identifier la provenance du
logiciel.

7. Garanties
Sauf mention contraire, le concédant
distribue le logiciel sans aucune garantie, aux risques et périls de
l'acquéreur de la copie du logiciel, et ce, sans assurer que le
logiciel puisse répondre à un besoin particulier ou puisse donner un
résultat quelconque. 

Sans lier le concédant d'une quelconque
manière, rien n'empêche un licencié d'offrir ou d'exclure des
garanties ou du support.

8. Responsabilité
Le licencié est
responsable de tout préjudice résultant de l'exercice des droits
accordés par la licence.

Le concédant ne saurait être tenu
responsable du préjudice subi par le licencié ou par des tiers, pour
quelque cause que ce soit en lien avec la licence et les droits qui y
sont accordés.

9. Résiliation
La présente licence est résiliée
de plein droit dès que les droits qui y sont accordés ne sont pas
exercés conformément aux termes qui y sont stipulés.

Toutefois, si
le défaut est corrigé dans un délai de 30 jours de sa prise de
connaissance par la personne en défaut, et qu'il s'agit du premier
défaut, la licence est accordée de nouveau.

Pour tout défaut
subséquent, le consentement exprès du concédant est nécessaire
afin que la licence soit accordée de nouveau.

10. Version de la
licence
Le Centre de services partagés du Québec, ses ayants cause
ou toute personne qu'il désigne, peuvent diffuser des versions
révisées ou modifiées de cette licence. Chaque version recevra un
numéro unique. Si un logiciel est déjà soumis aux termes d'une
version spécifique, c'est seulement cette version qui liera les
parties à la licence.

Le concédant peut aussi choisir de concéder
la licence sous la version actuelle ou toute version ultérieure,
auquel cas le licencié peut choisir sous quelle version la licence
lui est accordée.

11. Divers
Dans la mesure où le concédant est un
ministère, un organisme public ou une personne morale de droit
public, créés en vertu d'une loi de l'Assemblée nationale du
Québec, la licence est régie par le droit applicable au Québec et
en cas de contestation, les tribunaux du Québec seront seuls
compétents.

La présente licence peut être distribuée sans
conditions particulières. Toutefois, une version modifiée doit être
distribuée sous un nom différent. Toute référence au Centre de
services partagés du Québec, et, le cas échéant, ses ayant cause,
doit être retirée, autre que celle permettant d'identifier la
provenance de la licence.

apt for any kind of work (such as source code, fonts, documentation,

MirBSD. It has been drafted as universally usable equivalent of the
""historic permission notice""(2) adapted to Europen law because in some

is asserted unless advertising clauses are used. The MirOS Licence is
certified to conform to OKD(4) 1.0 and OSD(5) 1.9, and qualifies as a
Free Software(6) and also Free Documentation(7) licence and is

We believe you are not
liable for work inserted which is intellectual property of third
parties, if you were not aware of the fact, act appropriately as soon
as you become aware of that problem, seek an amicable solution for all
parties, and never knowingly distribute a work without being
authorised to do so by its licensors.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics
software materials and documentation is provided and donated to
Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN
Information Systems Inc. as a contribution to computer science
knowledge. This donation is made also to give evidence of the common
contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Bell
Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc.,
Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL and BULL HN Information Systems Inc.
to the development of this operating system. Multics development was
initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC
(1963-1970), renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and
Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership of
Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided
the best software architecture for managing computer hardware properly
and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems
incorporated Multics principles. Multics was distributed in 1975 to
2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information
Systems Inc., as successor in interest by change in name only to
Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc.
.

THIS OPEN SOURCE AGREEMENT
(""AGREEMENT"") DEFINES THE RIGHTS OF USE, REPRODUCTION, DISTRIBUTION,
MODIFICATION AND REDISTRIBUTION OF CERTAIN COMPUTER SOFTWARE
ORIGINALLY RELEASED BY THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT AS REPRESENTED BY
THE GOVERNMENT AGENCY LISTED BELOW (""GOVERNMENT AGENCY""). THE UNITED
STATES GOVERNMENT, AS REPRESENTED BY GOVERNMENT AGENCY, IS AN INTENDED
THIRD-PARTY BENEFICIARY OF ALL SUBSEQUENT DISTRIBUTIONS OR
REDISTRIBUTIONS OF THE SUBJECT SOFTWARE. ANYONE WHO USES, REPRODUCES,
DISTRIBUTES, MODIFIES OR REDISTRIBUTES THE SUBJECT SOFTWARE, AS
DEFINED HEREIN, OR ANY PART THEREOF, IS, BY THAT ACTION, ACCEPTING IN
FULL THE RESPONSIBILITIES AND OBLIGATIONS CONTAINED IN THIS
AGREEMENT.

Software, or portions thereof, with software separate from the Subject
Software that is not governed by the terms of this Agreement. F.
""Modification"" means any alteration of, including addition to or
deletion from, the substance or structure of either the Original
Software or Subject Software, and includes derivative works, as that
term is defined in the Copyright Statute, 17 USC 101. However, the act
of including Subject Software as part of a Larger Work does not in and
of itself constitute a Modification. G. ""Original Software"" means the
computer software first released under this Agreement by Government
Agency with Government Agency designation __ and entitled _________,
including source code, object code and accompanying documentation, if
any. H. ""Recipient"" means anyone who acquires the Subject Software
under this Agreement, including all Contributors. I. ""Redistribution""

C.
Each Contributor must characterize its alteration of the Subject
Software as a Modification and must identify itself as the originator
of its Modification in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent
Recipients to identify the originator of the Modification. In
fulfillment of these requirements, Contributor must include a file
(e.g., a change log file) that describes the alterations made and the
date of the alterations, identifies Contributor as originator of the
alterations, and consents to characterization of the alterations as a
Modification, for example, by including a statement that the
Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original
Software provided by Government Agency. Once consent is granted, it
may not thereafter be revoked.

D. A Contributor may add its own
copyright notice to the Subject Software. Once a copyright notice has
been added to the Subject Software, a Recipient may not remove it
without the express permission of the Contributor who added the
notice.

E. A Recipient may not make any representation in the Subject
Software or in any promotional, advertising or other material that may
be construed as an endorsement by Government Agency or by any prior

Recipient makes a Modification available, it is requested that the
Recipient inform Government Agency, by e-mail to the Government Agency
Point of Contact listed in clause 5.F., how to access the
Modification.

G. Each Contributor represents that that its
Modification is believed to be Contributor's original creation and
does not violate any existing agreements, regulations, statutes or
rules, and further that Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the
rights conveyed by this Agreement.

H. A Recipient may choose to
offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity and/or
liability obligations to one or more other Recipients of the Subject
Software. A Recipient may do so, however, only on its own behalf and
not on behalf of Government Agency or any other Recipient. Such a
Recipient must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty,
support, indemnity and/or liability obligation is offered by that
Recipient alone. Further, such Recipient agrees to indemnify
Government Agency and every other Recipient for any liability incurred
by them as a result of warranty, support, indemnity and/or liability
offered by such Recipient.

I. A Recipient may create a Larger Work by
combining Subject Software with separate software not governed by the

product. In such case, the Recipient must make sure Subject Software,
or portions thereof, included in the Larger Work is subject to this
Agreement.

J. Notwithstanding any provisions contained herein,
Recipient is hereby put on notice that export of any goods or
technical data from the United States may require some form of export
license from the U.S. Government. Failure to obtain necessary export
licenses may result in criminal liability under U.S. laws. Government
Agency neither represents that a license shall not be required nor
that, if required, it shall be issued. Nothing granted herein provides
any such export license.

DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES AND LIABILITIES;
WAIVER AND INDEMNIFICATION

A. No Warranty: THE SUBJECT SOFTWARE IS
PROVIDED ""AS IS"" WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED,

Rights Reserved.

Note: This license is derived from the ""Artistic
License"" as distributed with the Perl Programming Language. Its terms
are different from those of the ""Artistic License."" 

PREAMBLE

The
intent of this document is to state the conditions under which a
Package may be copied, such that the Copyright Holder maintains some
semblance of artistic control over the development of the package,
while giving the users of the package the right to use and distribute
the Package in a more-or-less customary fashion, plus the right to
make reasonable modifications.

Definitions:

     ""Package"" refers to
the collection of files distributed by the Copyright Holder, and
derivatives of that collection of files created through textual
modification.

     ""Standard Version"" refers to such a Package if it
has not been modified, or has been modified in accordance with the
wishes of the Copyright Holder.

     ""Copyright Holder"" is whoever is
named in the copyright or copyrights for the package.

     ""You"" is
you, if you're thinking about copying or distributing this Package.

 
   ""Reasonable copying fee"" is whatever you can justify on the basis
of media cost, duplication charges, time of people involved, and so
on. (You will not be required to justify it to the Copyright Holder,
but only to the computing community at large as a market that must
bear the fee.)

     ""Freely Available"" means that no fee is charged
for the item itself, though there may be fees involved in handling the
item. It also means that recipients of the item may redistribute it
under the same conditions they received it.

1. You may make and give
away verbatim copies of the source form of the Standard Version of
this Package without restriction, provided that you duplicate all of
the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.

2. You may
apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications derived
from the Public Domain or from the Copyright Holder. A Package
modified in such a way shall still be considered the Standard
Version.

3. You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any
way, provided that you insert a prominent notice in each changed file
stating how and when you changed that file, and provided that you do
at least ONE of the following:

     a) place your modifications in
the Public Domain or otherwise make them Freely Available, such as by
posting said modifications to Usenet or an equivalent medium, or
placing the modifications on a major archive site such as
uunet.uu.net, or by allowing the Copyright Holder to include your
modifications in the Standard Version of the Package.

     b) use the
modified Package only within your corporation or organization.

    
c) rename any non-standard executables so the names do not conflict
with standard executables, which must also be provided, and provide a
separate manual page for each non-standard executable that clearly
documents how it differs from the Standard Version.

     d) make
other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.

4. You may
distribute the programs of this Package in object code or executable
form, provided that you do at least ONE of the following:

     a)
distribute a Standard Version of the executables and library files,
together with instructions (in the manual page or equivalent) on where
to get the Standard Version.

     b) accompany the distribution with
the machine-readable source of the Package with your modifications.

 
   c) accompany any non-standard executables with their corresponding
Standard Version executables, giving the non-standard executables
non-standard names, and clearly documenting the differences in manual
pages (or equivalent), together with instructions on where to get the
Standard Version.

     d) make other distribution arrangements with
the Copyright Holder.

5. You may charge a reasonable copying fee for
any distribution of this Package. You may charge any fee you choose
for support of this Package. You may not charge a fee for this Package
itself. However, you may distribute this Package in aggregate with
other (possibly commercial) programs as part of a larger (possibly
commercial) software distribution provided that you do not advertise
this Package as a product of your own.

6. The scripts and library
files supplied as input to or produced as output from the programs of
this Package do not automatically fall under the copyright of this
Package, but belong to whomever generated them, and may be sold
commercially, and may be aggregated with this Package.

7. C
subroutines supplied by you and linked into this Package in order to
emulate subroutines and variables of the language defined by this
Package shall not be considered part of this Package, but are the
equivalent of input as in Paragraph 6, provided these subroutines do
not change the language in any way that would cause it to fail the
regression tests for the language.

8. The name of the Copyright
Holder may not be used to endorse or promote products derived from
this software without specific prior written permission.

9. THIS
PACKAGE IS PROVIDED ""AS IS"" AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED
WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTIBILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

(Copyright 1989 M. Stephenson) 
(Based
on the BISON general public license, copyright 1988 Richard M.
Stallman)

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim
copies of this license, but changing it is not allowed. You can also
use this wording to make the terms for other programs.

The license
agreements of most software companies keep you at the mercy of those
companies. By contrast, our general public license is intended to give
everyone the right to share NetHack. To make sure that you get the
rights we want you to have, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
Hence this license agreement.

Specifically, we want to make sure that
you have the right to give away copies of NetHack, that you receive
source code or else can get it if you want it, that you can change
NetHack or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know
you can do these things.

To make sure that everyone has such rights,
we have to forbid you to deprive anyone else of these rights. For
example, if you distribute copies of NetHack, you must give the
recipients all the rights that you have. You must make sure that they,
too, receive or can get the source code. And you must tell them their
rights.

Also, for our own protection, we must make certain that
everyone finds out that there is no warranty for NetHack. If NetHack
is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to
know that what they have is not what we distributed.

Therefore we
(Mike Stephenson and other holders of NetHack copyrights) make the
following terms which say what you must do to be allowed to distribute
or change NetHack.

COPYING POLICIES

You may copy and distribute
verbatim copies of NetHack source code as you receive it, in any
medium, provided that you keep intact the notices on all files that
refer to copyrights, to this License Agreement, and to the absence of
any warranty; and give any other recipients of the NetHack program a
copy of this License Agreement along with the program.

You may modify
your copy or copies of NetHack or any portion of it, and copy and
distribute such modifications under the terms of Paragraph 1 above
(including distributing this License Agreement), provided that you
also do the following:

     a) cause the modified files to carry
prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of
any change; and

     b) cause the whole of any work that you
distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is a
derivative of NetHack or any part thereof, to be licensed at no charge
to all third parties on terms identical to those contained in this
License Agreement (except that you may choose to grant more extensive
warranty protection to some or all third parties, at your option)

   
 c) You may charge a distribution fee for the physical act of
transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty
protection in exchange for a fee.

You may copy and distribute NetHack
(or a portion or derivative of it, under Paragraph 2) in object code
or executable form under the terms of Paragraphs 1 and 2 above
provided that you also do one of the following:

     a) accompany it
with the complete machine-readable source code, which must be
distributed under the terms of Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,

     b)
accompany it with full information as to how to obtain the complete
machine-readable source code from an appropriate archive site. (This
alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution.)

For
these purposes, complete source code means either the full source
distribution as originally released over Usenet or updated copies of
the files in this distribution used to create the object code or
executable.

You may not copy, sublicense, distribute or transfer
NetHack except as expressly provided under this License Agreement. Any
attempt otherwise to copy, sublicense, distribute or transfer NetHack
is void and your rights to use the program under this License
agreement shall be automatically terminated. However, parties who have
received computer software programs from you with this License
Agreement will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.
Stated plainly: You are permitted
to modify NetHack, or otherwise use parts of NetHack, provided that
you comply with the conditions specified above; in particular, your
modified NetHack or program containing parts of NetHack must remain
freely available as provided in this License Agreement. In other
words, go ahead and share NetHack, but don't try to stop anyone else
from sharing it farther.

Preface of
licence

This licence grants you the right to copy, use and distribute
information, provided you acknowledge the contributors and comply with
the terms and conditions stipulated in this licence. By using
information made available under this licence, you accept the terms
and conditions set forth in this licence. As set out in Section 7, the
licensor disclaims any and all liability for the quality of the
information and what the information is used for.

This licence shall
not impose any limitations on the rights or freedoms of the licensee
under the Norwegian Freedom of Information Act or any other
legislation granting the general public a right of access to public
sector information, or that follow from exemptions or limitations
stipulated in the Norwegian Copyright Act. Further, the licence shall
not impose any limitations on the licensee's freedom of expression
recognized by law.

1. Definitions
     
     «Database» shall mean
a database or similar protected under Section 43 of the Norwegian
Copyright Act.
     «Information» shall mean texts, images,
recordings, data sets or other works protected under Section 1 of the
Norwegian Copyright Act, or which are protected under provisions
addressing what is referred to as «neighbouring rights» in Chapter 5
of the Norwegian Copyright Act (including databases and photographs),
and which are distributed under this licence.
     «Copy» shall mean
reproduction in any form.
     «Licensee» and «you» shall mean
natural or legal persons using information under this licence.
    
«Licensor» shall mean the natural or legal person that makes
information available under this licence.
     «Distribute» shall
mean any actions whereby information is made available, including to
distribute, transfer, communicate, disperse, show, perform, sell, lend
and rent.
     «Use» shall mean one or more actions relevant to
copyright law requiring permission from the owner of the
copyright.
	
2. Licence
The licensee, subject to the limitations that
follow from this licence, may use the information for any purpose and
in all contexts, by:

     * copying the information and distributing
the information to others,
     * modifying the information and/or
combining the information with other information, and
     * copying
and distributing such changed or combined information.
     * This is
a non-exclusive, free, perpetual and worldwide licence. The
information may be used in any medium and format known today and/or
which will become known in the future. The Licensee shall not
sub-license or transfer this licence.

3. Exemptions
The licence does
not apply to and therefore does not grant a right to use:

     *
information which contains personal data covered by the Norwegian
Personal Data Act unless there is a legitimate basis for the
disclosure and further processing of the personal data
     *
information distributed in violation of a statutory obligation to
observe confidentiality
     * information excluded from public
disclosure pursuant to law, including information deemed sensitive
under the Norwegian National Security Act
     * information subject
to third party rights which the licensor is not authorised to license
to the licensee
     * information protected by intellectual property
rights other than copyright and neighbouring rights in accordance with
Chapter 5 of the Norwegian Copyright Act, such as trademarks, patents
and design rights, but this does not entail an impediment to use
information where the licensor's logo has been permanently integrated
into the information or to attribute the origin of the information in
accordance with the article below relating to attribution.

If the
licensor has made available information not covered by the licence
according to the above list, the licensee must cease all use of the
information under the licence, and erase the information as soon as he
or she becomes aware of or should have understood that the information
is not covered by the licence.

4. Effects of breach of the
licence
The licence is subject to the licensee's compliance with the
terms and conditions of this licence. In the event that the licensee
commits a breach of this licence, this will entail that the licensee's
right to use the information will be revoked immediately without
further notice. In case of such a breach, the licensee must
immediately and without further notice take measures to cause the
infringement to end. Because the right to use the information has been
terminated, the licensee must cease all use of the information by
virtue of the licence.

5. Attribution
The licensee shall attribute
the licensor as specified by the licensor and include a reference to
this licence. To the extent practically possible, the licensee shall
provide a link to both this licence and the source of the
information.

If the licensor has not specified how attributions shall
be made, the licensee shall normally state the following: «Contains
data under the Norwegian licence for Open Government data (NLOD)
distributed by [name of licensor]».

If the licensor has specified
that the information shall only be available under a specific version
of this licence, cf. Section 10, the licensee shall also state
this.

If the information has been changed, the licensee must clearly
indicate that changes have been made by the licensee.

6. Proper
use
The licensee shall not use the information in a manner that
appears misleading nor present the information in a distorted or
incorrect manner.
Neither the licensor's nor other contributors' names
or trademarks must be used to support, recommend or market the
licensee or any products or services using the information.

7.
Disclaimer of liability
The information is licensed «as is». The
information may contain errors and omissions. The licensor provides no
warranties, including relating to the content and relevance of the
information.

The licensor disclaims any liability for errors and
defects associated with the information to the maximum extent
permitted by law.

The licensor shall not be liable for direct or
indirect losses as a result of use of the information or in connection
with copying or further distribution of the information.

8.
Guarantees regarding data quality and accessibility
This licence does
not prevent the licensor from issuing supplementary statements
regarding expected or intended data quality and accessibility. Such
statements shall be regarded as indicative in nature and not binding
on the part of the licensor. The disclaimers in Section 7 also apply
in full for such indicative statements. Based on separate agreement,
the licensor may provide guarantees and distribute the information on
terms and conditions different from those set forth in this
licence.

9. Licence compatibility
If the licensee is to distribute an
adapted or combined work based on information covered by this licence
and some other work licensed under a licence compatible by contract,
such distribution may be based on an appropriate licence compatible by
contract, cf. the list below.

A licence compatible by contract shall
mean the following licences:

     * for all information: Open
Government Licence (version 1.0),
     * for those parts of the
information which do not constitute databases: Creative Commons
Attribution Licence (generic version 1.0, 2.0, 2.5 and unported
version 3.0) and Creative Commons Navngivelse 3.0 Norge,
     * for
those parts of the information which constitute databases: Open Data
Commons Attribution License (version 1.0).

This provision does not
prevent other licences from being compatible with this licence based
on their content.

10. New versions of the licence
The licensee may
choose to use the information covered by this licence under any new
versions of the Norwegian licence for Open Government data (NLOD)
issued by the responsible ministry (currently the Ministry of
Government Administration, Reform and Church Affairs) when these
versions are final and official, unless the licensor when making the
information available under this licence specifically has stated that
solely version 1.0 of this licence may be used.

11. Governing law and
legal venue
This licence, including its formation, and any disputes
and claims arising in connection with or relating to this licence,
shall be regulated by Norwegian law. The legal venue shall be the
licensor's ordinary legal venue. The licensor may, with regard to
intellectual proprietary rights, choose to pursue a claim at other
competent legal venues and/or based on the laws of the country where
the intellectual property rights are sought enforced.

or controlled by Contributor, to Utilize the Contributor Version (or
portions thereof), but solely to the extent that any such patent is
reasonably necessary to enable You to Utilize the Contributor Version
(or portions thereof), and not to any greater extent that may be
necessary to Utilize further Modifications or combinations.

3.
Distribution Obligations.
	
     3.1. Application of License. The
Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are governed
by the terms of this License, including without limitation Section
2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be distributed only
under the terms of this License or a future version of this License
released under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of this
License with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not
offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or
restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients'
rights hereunder. However, You may include an additional document
offering the additional rights described in Section 3.5.

     3.2.
Availability of Source Code. Any Modification which You create or to
which You contribute must be made available in Source Code form under
the terms of this License either on the same media as an Executable
version or via an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone
to whom you made an Executable version available; and if made
available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must remain available
for at least twelve (12) months after the date it initially became
available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent version of
that particular Modification has been made available to such
recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code
version remains available even if the Electronic Distribution
Mechanism is maintained by a third party. 

     3.3. Description of
Modifications. You must cause all Covered Code to which you contribute
to contain a file documenting the changes You made to create that
Covered Code and the date of any change. You must include a prominent
statement that the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly,
from Original Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the
name of the Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any
notice in an Executable version or related documentation in which You
describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Code. 

     3.4.
Intellectual Property Matters
          (a) Third Party Claims. If You
have knowledge that a party claims an intellectual property right in
particular functionality or code (or its utilization under this
License), you must include a text file with the source code
distribution titled ``LEGAL'' which describes the claim and the party
making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom
to contact. If you obtain such knowledge after You make Your
Modification available as described in Section 3.2, You shall promptly
modify the LEGAL file in all copies You make available thereafter and
shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or
newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the
Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.
          (b)
Contributor APIs. If Your Modification is an application programming
interface and You own or control patents which are reasonably
necessary to implement that API, you must also include this
information in the LEGAL file.
	
     3.5. Required Notices. You must
duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code, and
this License in any documentation for the Source Code, where You
describe recipients' rights relating to Covered Code. If You created
one or more Modification(s), You may add your name as a Contributor to
the notice described in Exhibit A. If it is not possible to put such
notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then you
must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory
file) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice. You may
choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity
or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code.
However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of
the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely
clear than any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability
obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify
the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred
by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty,
support, indemnity or liability terms You offer. 

     3.6.
Distribution of Executable Versions. You may distribute Covered Code
in Executable form only if the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have
been met for that Covered Code, and if You include a notice stating
that the Source Code version of the Covered Code is available under
the terms of this License, including a description of how and where
You have fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be
conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable version, related
documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients' rights
relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable
version of Covered Code under a license of Your choice, which may
contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in
compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the
Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's
rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this
License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different
license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ
from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial
Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the
Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by
the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such
terms You offer. 

     3.7. Larger Works. You may create a Larger
Work by combining Covered Code with other code not governed by the
terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single
product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this
License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.

4. Inability to Comply
Due to Statute or Regulation.
If it is impossible for You to comply
with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of
the Covered Code due to statute or regulation then You must: (a)
comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible;
and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such
description must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section
3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code.
Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such
description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary
skill to be able to understand it.

5. Application of this
License.
This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer
has attached the notice in Exhibit A, and to related Covered Code.

6.
Versions of the License.
     6.1. New Versions. Netscape
Communications Corporation (``Netscape'') may publish revised and/or
new versions of the License from time to time. Each version will be
given a distinguishing version number.
	
     6.2. Effect of New
Versions. Once Covered Code has been published under a particular
version of the License, You may always continue to use it under the
terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code
under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by
Netscape. No one other than Netscape has the right to modify the terms
applicable to Covered Code created under this License. 
		
     6.3.
Derivative Works. If you create or use a modified version of this
License (which you may only do in order to apply it to code which is
not already Covered Code governed by this License), you must (a)
rename Your license so that the phrases ``Mozilla'', ``MOZILLAPL'',
``MOZPL'', ``Netscape'', ``NPL'' or any confusingly similar phrase do
not appear anywhere in your license and (b) otherwise make it clear
that your version of the license contains terms which differ from the
Mozilla Public License and Netscape Public License. (Filling in the
name of the Initial Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the
notice described in Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be
modifications of this License.)

7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.

COVERED
CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN ``AS IS'' BASIS, WITHOUT
WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS,
MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE
ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS
WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU
(NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST
OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF
WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY
COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

8.
TERMINATION.

This License and the rights granted hereunder will
terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and
fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the
breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted
shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by
their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this
License shall survive.

9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

UNDER NO
CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING
NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY
OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER
OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY OTHER PERSON FOR ANY
INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY
CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL,
WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER
COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN
INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF
LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY
RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW
PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE
EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO
THAT EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

10. U.S.
GOVERNMENT END USERS.

The Covered Code is a ``commercial item,'' as
that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of
``commercial computer software'' and ``commercial computer software
documentation,'' as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept.
1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1
through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire
Covered Code with only those rights set forth herein.

11.
MISCELLANEOUS.

This License represents the complete agreement
concerning subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is
held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the
extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be
governed by California law provisions (except to the extent applicable
law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law
provisions. With respect to disputes in which at least one party is a
citizen of, or an entity chartered or registered to do business in,
the United States of America: (a) unless otherwise agreed in writing,
all disputes relating to this License (excepting any dispute relating
to intellectual property rights) shall be subject to final and binding
arbitration, with the losing party paying all costs of arbitration;
(b) any arbitration relating to this Agreement shall be held in Santa
Clara County, California, under the auspices of JAMS/EndDispute; and
(c) any litigation relating to this Agreement shall be subject to the
jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern District of
California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County, California, with
the losing party responsible for costs, including without limitation,
court costs and reasonable attorneys fees and expenses. The
application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the
International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or
regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be
construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License.

12.
RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.

Except in cases where another Contributor
has failed to comply with Section 3.4, You are responsible for damages
arising, directly or indirectly, out of Your utilization of rights
under this License, based on the number of copies of Covered Code you
made available, the revenues you received from utilizing such rights,
and other relevant factors. You agree to work with affected parties to
distribute responsibility on an equitable
basis.

AMENDMENTS
Additional Terms applicable to the Netscape Public
License.

     I. Effect.  
These additional terms described in this
Netscape Public License -- Amendments shall apply to the Mozilla
Communicator client code and to all Covered Code under this
License. 

     II. ``Netscape's Branded Code'' means Covered Code
that Netscape distributes and/or permits others to distribute under
one or more trademark(s) which are controlled by Netscape but which
are not licensed for use under this License. 

     III. Netscape and
logo.  
     This License does not grant any rights to use the
trademark ``Netscape'', the ``Netscape N and horizon'' logo or the
Netscape lighthouse logo, even if such marks are included in the
Original Code. 

     IV. Inability to Comply Due to Contractual
Obligation.  
     Prior to licensing the Original Code under this
License, Netscape has licensed third party code for use in Netscape's
Branded Code. To the extent that Netscape is limited contractually
from making such third party code available under this License,
Netscape may choose to reintegrate such code into Covered Code without
being required to distribute such code in 
Source Code form, even if
such code would otherwise be considered ``Modifications'' under this
License. 

     V. Use of Modifications and Covered Code by Initial
Developer.
          V.1. In General. The obligations of Section 3
apply to Netscape, except to the extent specified in this Amendment,
Section V.2 and V.3. 
          V.2. Other Products. Netscape may
include Covered Code in products other than the Netscape's Branded
Code which are released by Netscape during the two (2) years following
the release date of the Original Code, without such additional
products becoming subject to the terms of this License, and may
license such additional products on different terms from those
contained in this License. 
          V.3. Alternative Licensing.
Netscape may license the Source Code of Netscape's Branded Code,
including Modifications incorporated therein, without such additional
products becoming subject to the terms of this License, and may
license such additional products on different terms from those
contained in this License.
	
     VI. Arbitration and Litigation.  
 
   Notwithstanding the limitations of Section 11 above, the provisions
regarding arbitration and litigation in Section 11(a), (b) and (c) of
the License shall apply to all disputes relating to this
License.

3. DISTRIBUTION OBLIGATIONS.

     3.1 Application of
License. 
     The Modifications which You create or to which You
contribute are governed by the terms of this License, including
without limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered
Software may be distributed only under the terms of this License or a
future version of this License released under Section 6.1, and You
must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code
You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source
Code version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this
License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include
an additional document offering the additional rights described in
Section 3.5.

     3.2 Availability of Source Code.
     Any
Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be made
available in Source Code form under the terms of this License either
on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted
Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an
Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic
Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12)
months after the date it initially became available, or at least six
(6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification
has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for
ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the
Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.

   
 3.3 Description of Modifications.
     You must cause all Covered
Software to which You contribute to contain a file documenting the
changes You made to create that Covered Software and the date of any
change. You must include a prominent statement that the Modification
is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Software provided by
Nokia and including the name of Nokia in (a) the Source Code, and (b)
in any notice in an Executable version or related documentation in
which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Software.

 
   3.4 Intellectual Property Matters

          (a) Third Party
Claims. If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third
party's intellectual property rights is required to exercise the
rights granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2,
Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code distribution
titled ""LEGAL"" which describes the claim and the party making the
claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact.
If Contributor obtains such knowledge after the Modification is made
available as described in Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly
modify the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor makes available
thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate
mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who
received the Covered Software that new knowledge has been obtained.

 
        (b) Contributor APIs. If Contributor's Modifications include
an application programming interface and Contributor has knowledge of
patent licenses which are reasonably necessary to implement that API,
Contributor must also include this information in the LEGAL file.

   
      (c) Representations. Contributor represents that, except as
disclosed pursuant to Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that
Contributor's Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s)
and/or Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed
by this License.

     3.5 Required Notices.
     You must duplicate
the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code. If it is not
possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to
its structure, then You must include such notice in a location (such
as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely to look for such
a notice. If You created one or more Modification(s) You may add your
name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. You must
also duplicate this License in any documentation for the Source Code
where You describe recipients' rights or ownership rights relating to
Covered Software. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for,
warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more
recipients of Covered Software. However, You may do so only on Your
own behalf, and not on behalf of Nokia or any Contributor. You must
make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or
liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to
indemnify Nokia and every Contributor for any liability incurred by
Nokia or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity
or liability terms You offer.

     3.6 Distribution of Executable
Versions.
     You may distribute Covered Software in Executable form
only if the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that
Covered Software, and if You include a notice stating that the Source
Code version of the Covered Software is available under the terms of
this License, including a description of how and where You have
fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be
conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable version, related
documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients' rights
relating to the Covered Software. You may distribute the Executable
version of Covered Software or ownership rights under a license of
Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License,
provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and
that the license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit
or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code version from the
rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable
version under a different license You must make it absolutely clear
that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You
alone, not by Nokia or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify
Nokia and every Contributor for any liability incurred by Nokia or
such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.

     3.7
Larger Works.
     You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered
Software with other software not governed by the terms of this License
and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case,
You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for
the Covered Software.

4. INABILITY TO COMPLY DUE TO STATUTE OR
REGULATION.
If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the
terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered
Software due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must:
(a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent
possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect.
Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described in
Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the Source
Code.

Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such
description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary
skill to be able to understand it.

5. APPLICATION OF THIS
LICENSE.
This License applies to code to which Nokia has attached the
notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Software.

6. VERSIONS OF
THE LICENSE. 

     6.1 New Versions.
     Nokia may publish revised
and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version
will be given a distinguishing version number.

     6.2 Effect of New
Versions.
     Once Covered Software has been published under a
particular version of the License, You may always continue to use it
under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such
Covered Software under the terms of any subsequent version of the
License published by Nokia. No one other than Nokia has the right to
modify the terms applicable to Covered Software created under this
License.

7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.
COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED
UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN ""AS IS"" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES
THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE
QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD
ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT NOKIA,
ITS LICENSORS OR AFFILIATES OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST
OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF
WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY
COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS
DISCLAIMER.

8. TERMINATION.

     8.1 This License and the rights
granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply
with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of
becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Software
which are properly granted shall survive any termination of this
License. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect
beyond the termination of this License shall survive.

     8.2 If You
initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim
(excluding declatory judgment actions) against Nokia or a Contributor
(Nokia or Contributor against whom You file such action is referred to
as ""Participant"") alleging that:

          a) such Participant's
Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then
any and all rights granted by such Participant to You under Sections
2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from
Participant terminate prospectively, unless if within 60 days after
receipt of notice You either: (i) agree in writing to pay Participant
a mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and future use
of Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your
litigation claim with respect to the Contributor Version against such
Participant. If within 60 days of notice, a reasonable royalty and
payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the
parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted
by Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically
terminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice period specified
above.

          b) any software, hardware, or device, other than
such Participant's Contributor Version, directly or indirectly
infringes any patent, then any rights granted to You by such
Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as
of the date You first made, used, sold, distributed, or had made,
Modifications made by that Participant.

     8.3 If You assert a
patent infringement claim against Participant alleging that such
Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any
patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement)
prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the
reasonable value of the licenses granted by such Participant under
Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the
amount or value of any payment or license.

     8.4 In the event of
termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all end user license
agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been
validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to
termination shall survive termination.

9. LIMITATION OF
LIABILITY.
UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER
TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, NOKIA,
ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY
SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY
INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY
CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL,
WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER
COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN
INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF
LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY
RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW
PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE
EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, BUT
MAY ALLOW LIABILITY TO BE LIMITED; IN SUCH CASES, A PARTY's, ITS
EMPLOYEES, LICENSORS OR AFFILIATES' LIABILITY SHALL BE LIMITED TO U.S.
$50. Nothing contained in this License shall prejudice the statutory
rights of any party dealing as a consumer.

10. MISCELLANEOUS.
This
License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter
hereof. All rights in the Covered Software not expressly granted under
this License are reserved. Nothing in this License shall grant You any
rights to use any of the trademarks of Nokia or any of its Affiliates,
even if any of such trademarks are included in any part of Covered
Software and/or documentation to it.

This License is governed by the
laws of Finland excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. All disputes
arising from or relating to this Agreement shall be settled by a
single arbitrator appointed by the Central Chamber of Commerce of
Finland. The arbitration procedure shall take place in Helsinki,
Finland in the English language. If any part of this Agreement is
found void and unenforceable, it will not affect the validity of the
balance of the Agreement, which shall remain valid and enforceable
according to its terms.

11. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.
As between
Nokia and the Contributors, each party is responsible for claims and
damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of
rights under this License and You agree to work with Nokia and
Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis.
Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any
admission of liability.

Preamble

The Open Database License
(ODbL) is a license agreement intended to allow users to freely share,
modify, and use this Database while maintaining this same freedom for
others. Many databases are covered by copyright, and therefore this
document licenses these rights. Some jurisdictions, mainly in the
European Union, have specific rights that cover databases, and so the
ODbL addresses these rights, too. Finally, the ODbL is also an
agreement in contract for users of this Database to act in certain
ways in return for accessing this Database.

Databases can contain a
wide variety of types of content (images, audiovisual material, and
sounds all in the same database, for example), and so the ODbL only
governs the rights over the Database, and not the contents of the
Database individually. Licensors should use the ODbL together with
another license for the contents, if the contents have a single set of
rights that uniformly covers all of the contents. If the contents have
multiple sets of different rights, Licensors should describe what
rights govern what contents together in the individual record or in
some other way that clarifies what rights apply. 

Sometimes the
contents of a database, or the database itself, can be covered by
other rights not addressed here (such as private contracts, trade mark
over the name, or privacy rights / data protection rights over
information in the contents), and so you are advised that you may have
to consult other documents or clear other rights before doing
activities not covered by this License.

------

The Licensor (as
defined below) 

and 

You (as defined below) 

agree as follows:


1.0 Definitions of Capitalised Words

""Collective Database"" –
Means this Database in unmodified form as part of a collection of
independent databases in themselves that together are assembled into a
collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collective Database will
not be considered a Derivative Database.

""Convey"" – As a verb,
means Using the Database, a Derivative Database, or the Database as
part of a Collective Database in any way that enables a Person to make
or receive copies of the Database or a Derivative Database. Conveying
does not include interaction with a user through a computer network,
or creating and Using a Produced Work, where no transfer of a copy of
the Database or a Derivative Database occurs. ""Contents"" – The
contents of this Database, which includes the information, independent
works, or other material collected into the Database. For example, the
contents of the Database could be factual data or works such as
images, audiovisual material, text, or sounds.

""Database"" – A
collection of material (the Contents) arranged in a systematic or
methodical way and individually accessible by electronic or other
means offered under the terms of this License.

""Database Directive""
– Means Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the
Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, as
amended or succeeded.

""Database Right"" – Means rights resulting
from the Chapter III (""sui generis"") rights in the Database Directive
(as amended and as transposed by member states), which includes the
Extraction and Re-utilisation of the whole or a Substantial part of
the Contents, as well as any similar rights available in the relevant
jurisdiction under Section 10.4. 

""Derivative Database"" – Means a
database based upon the Database, and includes any translation,
adaptation, arrangement, modification, or any other alteration of the
Database or of a Substantial part of the Contents. This includes, but
is not limited to, Extracting or Re-utilising the whole or a
Substantial part of the Contents in a new Database.

""Extraction"" –
Means the permanent or temporary transfer of all or a Substantial part
of the Contents to another medium by any means or in any
form.

""License"" – Means this license agreement and is both a
license of rights such as copyright and Database Rights and an
agreement in contract.

""Licensor"" – Means the Person that offers
the Database under the terms of this License. 

""Person"" – Means a
natural or legal person or a body of persons corporate or
incorporate.

""Produced Work"" – a work (such as an image,
audiovisual material, text, or sounds) resulting from using the whole
or a Substantial part of the Contents (via a search or other query)
from this Database, a Derivative Database, or this Database as part of
a Collective Database. 

""Publicly"" – means to Persons other than
You or under Your control by either more than 50% ownership or by the
power to direct their activities (such as contracting with an
independent consultant). 

""Re-utilisation"" – means any form of
making available to the public all or a Substantial part of the
Contents by the distribution of copies, by renting, by online or other
forms of transmission.

""Substantial"" – Means substantial in terms
of quantity or quality or a combination of both. The repeated and
systematic Extraction or Re-utilisation of insubstantial parts of the
Contents may amount to the Extraction or Re-utilisation of a
Substantial part of the Contents.

""Use"" – As a verb, means doing
any act that is restricted by copyright or Database Rights whether in
the original medium or any other; and includes without limitation
distributing, copying, publicly performing, publicly displaying, and
preparing derivative works of the Database, as well as modifying the
Database as may be technically necessary to use it in a different mode
or format. 

""You"" – Means a Person exercising rights under this
License who has not previously violated the terms of this License with
respect to the Database, or who has received express permission from
the Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a previous
violation.

Words in the singular include the plural and vice
versa.

2.0 What this License covers

2.1. Legal effect of this
document. This License is:

     a. A license of applicable copyright
and neighbouring rights;

     b. A license of the Database Right;
and

     c. An agreement in contract between You and the
Licensor.

2.2 Legal rights covered. This License covers the legal
rights in the Database, including:

     a. Copyright. Any copyright
or neighbouring rights in the Database. The copyright licensed
includes any individual elements of the Database, but does not cover
the copyright over the Contents independent of this Database. See
Section 2.4 for details. Copyright law varies between jurisdictions,
but is likely to cover: the Database model or schema, which is the
structure, arrangement, and organisation of the Database, and can also
include the Database tables and table indexes; the data entry and
output sheets; and the Field names of Contents stored in the
Database;

     b. Database Rights. Database Rights only extend to the
Extraction and Re-utilisation of the whole or a Substantial part of
the Contents. Database Rights can apply even when there is no
copyright over the Database. Database Rights can also apply when the
Contents are removed from the Database and are selected and arranged
in a way that would not infringe any applicable copyright; and

    
c. Contract. This is an agreement between You and the Licensor for
access to the Database. In return you agree to certain conditions of
use on this access as outlined in this License. 

2.3 Rights not
covered. 

     a. This License does not apply to computer programs
used in the making or operation of the Database; 

     b. This
License does not cover any patents over the Contents or the Database;
and

     c. This License does not cover any trademarks associated
with the Database. 

2.4 Relationship to Contents in the Database. The
individual items of the Contents contained in this Database may be
covered by other rights, including copyright, patent, data protection,
privacy, or personality rights, and this License does not cover any
rights (other than Database Rights or in contract) in individual
Contents contained in the Database. For example, if used on a Database
of images (the Contents), this License would not apply to copyright
over individual images, which could have their own separate licenses,
or one single license covering all of the rights over the images.


3.0 Rights granted

3.1 Subject to the terms and conditions of this
License, the Licensor grants to You a worldwide, royalty-free,
non-exclusive, terminable (but only under Section 9) license to Use
the Database for the duration of any applicable copyright and Database
Rights. These rights explicitly include commercial use, and do not
exclude any field of endeavour. To the extent possible in the relevant
jurisdiction, these rights may be exercised in all media and formats
whether now known or created in the future. 

The rights granted
cover, for example:

     a. Extraction and Re-utilisation of the
whole or a Substantial part of the Contents;

     b. Creation of
Derivative Databases;

     c. Creation of Collective Databases;

    
d. Creation of temporary or permanent reproductions by any means and
in any form, in whole or in part, including of any Derivative
Databases or as a part of Collective Databases; and

     e.
Distribution, communication, display, lending, making available, or
performance to the public by any means and in any form, in whole or in
part, including of any Derivative Database or as a part of Collective
Databases.

3.2 Compulsory license schemes. For the avoidance of
doubt:

     a. Non-waivable compulsory license schemes. In those
jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any
statutory or compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the
Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for
any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License;

     b.
Waivable compulsory license schemes. In those jurisdictions in which
the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory
licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the exclusive
right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights
granted under this License; and,

     c. Voluntary license schemes.
The Licensor waives the right to collect royalties, whether
individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a member of a
collecting society that administers voluntary licensing schemes, via
that society, from any exercise by You of the rights granted under
this License.

3.3 The right to release the Database under different
terms, or to stop distributing or making available the Database, is
reserved. Note that this Database may be multiple-licensed, and so You
may have the choice of using alternative licenses for this Database.
Subject to Section 10.4, all other rights not expressly granted by
Licensor are reserved.

4.0 Conditions of Use

4.1 The rights granted
in Section 3 above are expressly made subject to Your complying with
the following conditions of use. These are important conditions of
this License, and if You fail to follow them, You will be in material
breach of its terms.

4.2 Notices. If You Publicly Convey this
Database, any Derivative Database, or the Database as part of a
Collective Database, then You must: 

     a. Do so only under the
terms of this License or another license permitted under Section
4.4;

     b. Include a copy of this License (or, as applicable, a
license permitted under Section 4.4) or its Uniform Resource
Identifier (URI) with the Database or Derivative Database, including
both in the Database or Derivative Database and in any relevant
documentation; and

     c. Keep intact any copyright or Database
Right notices and notices that refer to this License.

     d. If it
is not possible to put the required notices in a particular file due
to its structure, then You must include the notices in a location
(such as a relevant directory) where users would be likely to look for
it.

4.3 Notice for using output (Contents). Creating and Using a
Produced Work does not require the notice in Section 4.2. However, if
you Publicly Use a Produced Work, You must include a notice associated
with the Produced Work reasonably calculated to make any Person that
uses, views, accesses, interacts with, or is otherwise exposed to the
Produced Work aware that Content was obtained from the Database,
Derivative Database, or the Database as part of a Collective Database,
and that it is available under this License.

     a. Example notice.
The following text will satisfy notice under Section 4.3:

         
Contains information from DATABASE NAME, which is made available here
under the Open Database License (ODbL).

DATABASE NAME should be
replaced with the name of the Database and a hyperlink to the URI of
the Database. ""Open Database License"" should contain a hyperlink to
the URI of the text of this License. If hyperlinks are not possible,
You should include the plain text of the required URI's with the above
notice. 4.4 Share alike. 

     a. Any Derivative Database that You
Publicly Use must be only under the terms of: 

          i. This
License;

          ii. A later version of this License similar in
spirit to this License; or

          iii. A compatible license. 

   
 If You license the Derivative Database under one of the licenses
mentioned in (iii), You must comply with the terms of that license. 


    b. For the avoidance of doubt, Extraction or Re-utilisation of the
whole or a Substantial part of the Contents into a new database is a
Derivative Database and must comply with Section 4.4. 

     c.
Derivative Databases and Produced Works. A Derivative Database is
Publicly Used and so must comply with Section 4.4. if a Produced Work
created from the Derivative Database is Publicly Used.

     d. Share
Alike and additional Contents. For the avoidance of doubt, You must
not add Contents to Derivative Databases under Section 4.4 a that are
incompatible with the rights granted under this License. 

     e.
Compatible licenses. Licensors may authorise a proxy to determine
compatible licenses under Section 4.4 a iii. If they do so, the
authorised proxy's public statement of acceptance of a compatible
license grants You permission to use the compatible license. 

4.5
Limits of Share Alike. The requirements of Section 4.4 do not apply in
the following:

     a. For the avoidance of doubt, You are not
required to license Collective Databases under this License if You
incorporate this Database or a Derivative Database in the collection,
but this License still applies to this Database or a Derivative
Database as a part of the Collective Database; 

     b. Using this
Database, a Derivative Database, or this Database as part of a
Collective Database to create a Produced Work does not create a
Derivative Database for purposes of Section 4.4; and

     c. Use of a
Derivative Database internally within an organisation is not to the
public and therefore does not fall under the requirements of Section
4.4.

4.6 Access to Derivative Databases. If You Publicly Use a
Derivative Database or a Produced Work from a Derivative Database, You
must also offer to recipients of the Derivative Database or Produced
Work a copy in a machine readable form of:

     a. The entire
Derivative Database; or

     b. A file containing all of the
alterations made to the Database or the method of making the
alterations to the Database (such as an algorithm), including any
additional Contents, that make up all the differences between the
Database and the Derivative Database.

The Derivative Database (under
a.) or alteration file (under b.) must be available at no more than a
reasonable production cost for physical distributions and free of
charge if distributed over the internet.

4.7 Technological measures
and additional terms

     a. This License does not allow You to
impose (except subject to Section 4.7 b.) any terms or any
technological measures on the Database, a Derivative Database, or the
whole or a Substantial part of the Contents that alter or restrict the
terms of this License, or any rights granted under it, or have the
effect or intent of restricting the ability of any person to exercise
those rights.

     b. Parallel distribution. You may impose terms or
technological measures on the Database, a Derivative Database, or the
whole or a Substantial part of the Contents (a ""Restricted Database"")
in contravention of Section 4.74 a. only if You also make a copy of
the Database or a Derivative Database available to the recipient of
the Restricted Database:

          i. That is available without
additional fee;

          ii. That is available in a medium that does
not alter or restrict the terms of this License, or any rights granted
under it, or have the effect or intent of restricting the ability of
any person to exercise those rights (an ""Unrestricted Database"");
and

          iii. The Unrestricted Database is at least as
accessible to the recipient as a practical matter as the Restricted
Database.

     c. For the avoidance of doubt, You may place this
Database or a Derivative Database in an authenticated environment,
behind a password, or within a similar access control scheme provided
that You do not alter or restrict the terms of this License or any
rights granted under it or have the effect or intent of restricting
the ability of any person to exercise those rights. 

4.8 Licensing of
others. You may not sublicense the Database. Each time You communicate
the Database, the whole or Substantial part of the Contents, or any
Derivative Database to anyone else in any way, the Licensor offers to
the recipient a license to the Database on the same terms and
conditions as this License. You are not responsible for enforcing
compliance by third parties with this License, but You may enforce any
rights that You have over a Derivative Database. You are solely
responsible for any modifications of a Derivative Database made by You
or another Person at Your direction. You may not impose any further
restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under
this License.

5.0 Moral rights

5.1 Moral rights. This section covers
moral rights, including any rights to be identified as the author of
the Database or to object to treatment that would otherwise prejudice
the author's honour and reputation, or any other derogatory
treatment:

     a. For jurisdictions allowing waiver of moral rights,
Licensor waives all moral rights that Licensor may have in the
Database to the fullest extent possible by the law of the relevant
jurisdiction under Section 10.4; 

     b. If waiver of moral rights
under Section 5.1 a in the relevant jurisdiction is not possible,
Licensor agrees not to assert any moral rights over the Database and
waives all claims in moral rights to the fullest extent possible by
the law of the relevant jurisdiction under Section 10.4; and

     c.
For jurisdictions not allowing waiver or an agreement not to assert
moral rights under Section 5.1 a and b, the author may retain their
moral rights over certain aspects of the Database.

Please note that
some jurisdictions do not allow for the waiver of moral rights, and so
moral rights may still subsist over the Database in some
jurisdictions.

6.0 Fair dealing, Database exceptions, and other
rights not affected 

6.1 This License does not affect any rights that
You or anyone else may independently have under any applicable law to
make any use of this Database, including without limitation:

     a.
Exceptions to the Database Right including: Extraction of Contents
from non-electronic Databases for private purposes, Extraction for
purposes of illustration for teaching or scientific research, and
Extraction or Re-utilisation for public security or an administrative
or judicial procedure. 

     b. Fair dealing, fair use, or any other
legally recognised limitation or exception to infringement of
copyright or other applicable laws. 

6.2 This License does not affect
any rights of lawful users to Extract and Re-utilise insubstantial
parts of the Contents, evaluated quantitatively or qualitatively, for
any purposes whatsoever, including creating a Derivative Database
(subject to other rights over the Contents, see Section 2.4). The
repeated and systematic Extraction or Re-utilisation of insubstantial
parts of the Contents may however amount to the Extraction or
Re-utilisation of a Substantial part of the Contents.

7.0 Warranties
and Disclaimer

7.1 The Database is licensed by the Licensor ""as is""
and without any warranty of any kind, either express, implied, or
arising by statute, custom, course of dealing, or trade usage.
Licensor specifically disclaims any and all implied warranties or
conditions of title, non-infringement, accuracy or completeness, the
presence or absence of errors, fitness for a particular purpose,
merchantability, or otherwise. Some jurisdictions do not allow the
exclusion of implied warranties, so this exclusion may not apply to
You.

8.0 Limitation of liability

8.1 Subject to any liability that
may not be excluded or limited by law, the Licensor is not liable for,
and expressly excludes, all liability for loss or damage however and
whenever caused to anyone by any use under this License, whether by
You or by anyone else, and whether caused by any fault on the part of
the Licensor or not. This exclusion of liability includes, but is not
limited to, any special, incidental, consequential, punitive, or
exemplary damages such as loss of revenue, data, anticipated profits,
and lost business. This exclusion applies even if the Licensor has
been advised of the possibility of such damages.

8.2 If liability may
not be excluded by law, it is limited to actual and direct financial
loss to the extent it is caused by proved negligence on the part of
the Licensor.

9.0 Termination of Your rights under this License

9.1
Any breach by You of the terms and conditions of this License
automatically terminates this License with immediate effect and
without notice to You. For the avoidance of doubt, Persons who have
received the Database, the whole or a Substantial part of the
Contents, Derivative Databases, or the Database as part of a
Collective Database from You under this License will not have their
licenses terminated provided their use is in full compliance with this
License or a license granted under Section 4.8 of this License.
Sections 1, 2, 7, 8, 9 and 10 will survive any termination of this
License.

9.2 If You are not in breach of the terms of this License,
the Licensor will not terminate Your rights under it. 

9.3 Unless
terminated under Section 9.1, this License is granted to You for the
duration of applicable rights in the Database. 

9.4 Reinstatement of
rights. If you cease any breach of the terms and conditions of this
License, then your full rights under this License will be
reinstated:

     a. Provisionally and subject to permanent
termination until the 60th day after cessation of breach; 

     b.
Permanently on the 60th day after cessation of breach unless otherwise
reasonably notified by the Licensor; or

     c. Permanently if
reasonably notified by the Licensor of the violation, this is the
first time You have received notice of violation of this License from
the Licensor, and You cure the violation prior to 30 days after your
receipt of the notice.

Persons subject to permanent termination of
rights are not eligible to be a recipient and receive a license under
Section 4.8.

9.5 Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the
right to release the Database under different license terms or to stop
distributing or making available the Database. Releasing the Database
under different license terms or stopping the distribution of the
Database will not withdraw this License (or any other license that has
been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License),
and this License will continue in full force and effect unless
terminated as stated above.

10.0 General

10.1 If any provision of
this License is held to be invalid or unenforceable, that must not
affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms
and conditions of this License and each remaining provision of this
License shall be valid and enforced to the fullest extent permitted by
law. 

10.2 This License is the entire agreement between the parties
with respect to the rights granted here over the Database. It replaces
any earlier understandings, agreements or representations with respect
to the Database. 

10.3 If You are in breach of the terms of this
License, You will not be entitled to rely on the terms of this License
or to complain of any breach by the Licensor. 

10.4 Choice of law.
This License takes effect in and will be governed by the laws of the
relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be
enforced. If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable
copyright law and Database Rights in the relevant jurisdiction
includes additional rights not granted under this License, these
additional rights are granted in this License in order to meet the
terms of this License.

Version 1.0 - 22 November 2005

PREAMBLE 

The
goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide
development of cooperative font projects, to support the font creation
efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide an open
framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership
with others.

SIL OPEN FONT LICENSE

Version 1.1 - 26 February 2007

PREAMBLE 

The
goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide
development of collaborative font projects, to support the font
creation efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to
provide a free and open framework in which fonts may be shared and
improved in partnership with others.

The OFL allows the licensed
fonts to be used, studied, modified and redistributed freely as long
as they are not sold by themselves. The fonts, including any
derivative works, can be bundled, embedded, redistributed and/or sold
with any software provided that any reserved names are not used by
derivative works. The fonts and derivatives, however, cannot be
released under any other type of license. The requirement for fonts to
remain under this license does not apply to any document created using
the fonts or their derivatives.

DEFINITIONS 

""Font Software"" refers
to the set of files released by the Copyright Holder(s) under this
license and clearly marked as such. This may include source files,
build scripts and documentation.

""Reserved Font Name"" refers to any
names specified as such after the copyright statement(s).

""Original
Version"" refers to the collection of Font Software components as
distributed by the Copyright Holder(s).

""Modified Version"" refers to
any derivative made by adding to, deleting, or substituting — in
part or in whole — any of the components of the Original Version, by
changing formats or by porting the Font Software to a new
environment.

""Author"" refers to any designer, engineer, programmer,
technical writer or other person who contributed to the Font
Software.

PERMISSION & CONDITIONS 

Permission is hereby granted,
free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of the Font Software,
to use, study, copy, merge, embed, modify, redistribute, and sell
modified and unmodified copies of the Font Software, subject to the
following conditions:

1) Neither the Font Software nor any of its
individual components, in Original or Modified Versions, may be sold
by itself.

2) Original or Modified Versions of the Font Software may
be bundled, redistributed and/or sold with any software, provided that
each copy contains the above copyright notice and this license. These
can be included either as stand-alone text files, human-readable
headers or in the appropriate machine-readable metadata fields within
text or binary files as long as those fields can be easily viewed by
the user.

3) No Modified Version of the Font Software may use the
Reserved Font Name(s) unless explicit written permission is granted by
the corresponding Copyright Holder. This restriction only applies to

Preamble

The intent of this
document is to state the conditions under which a Package may be
copied, such that the Copyright Holder maintains some semblance of
artistic control over the development of the package, while giving the
users of the package the right to use and distribute the Package in a
more-or-less customary fashion, plus the right to make reasonable
modifications.

Testing is essential for proper development and
maintenance of standards-based products.

For buyers: adequate
conformance testing leads to reduced integration costs and protection
of investments in applications, software and people.

For software
developers: conformance testing of platforms and middleware greatly
reduces the cost of developing and maintaining multi-platform
application software.

For suppliers: In-depth testing increases
customer satisfaction and keeps development and support costs in
check. API conformance is highly measurable and suppliers who claim it
must be able to substantiate that claim.

As such, since these are
benchmark measures of conformance, we feel the integrity of test tools
is of importance. In order to preserve the integrity of the existing
conformance modes of this test package and to permit recipients of
modified versions of this package to run the original test modes, this
license requires that the original test modes be preserved.

If you
find a bug in one of the standards mode test cases, please let us know
so we can feed this back into the original, and also raise any
specification issues with the appropriate bodies (for example the
POSIX committees).

Definitions: 

     ""Package"" refers to the
collection of files distributed by the Copyright Holder, and
derivatives of that collection of files created through textual
modification. 

     ""Standard Version"" refers to such a Package if it
has not been modified, or has been modified in accordance with the
wishes of the Copyright Holder. 

     ""Copyright Holder"" is whoever
is named in the copyright or copyrights for the package. 

     ""You""
is you, if you're thinking about copying or distributing this Package.


     ""Reasonable copying fee"" is whatever you can justify on the
basis of media cost, duplication charges, time of people involved, and
so on. (You will not be required to justify it to the Copyright
Holder, but only to the computing community at large as a market that
must bear the fee.) 

     ""Freely Available"" means that no fee is
charged for the item itself, though there may be fees involved in
handling the item. It also means that recipients of the item may
redistribute it under the same conditions they received it. 

1. You
may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the
Standard Version of this Package without restriction, provided that
you duplicate all of the original copyright notices and associated
disclaimers.

2. You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other
modifications derived from the Public Domain or from the Copyright
Holder. A Package modified in such a way shall still be considered the
Standard Version.

3. You may otherwise modify your copy of this
Package in any way, provided that you insert a prominent notice in
each changed file stating how and when you changed that file, and
provided that you do at least the following:

     rename any
non-standard executables and testcases so the names do not conflict
with standard executables and testcases, which must also be provided,
and provide a separate manual page for each non-standard executable
and testcase that clearly documents how it differs from the Standard
Version.

4. You may distribute the programs of this Package in object
code or executable form, provided that you do at least the following:


     accompany any non-standard executables and testcases with their
corresponding Standard Version executables and testcases, giving the
non-standard executables and testcases non-standard names, and clearly
documenting the differences in manual pages (or equivalent), together
with instructions on where to get the Standard Version.

5. You may
charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of this Package.
You may charge any fee you choose for support of this Package. You may
not charge a fee for this Package itself. However, you may distribute
this Package in aggregate with other (possibly commercial) programs as
part of a larger (possibly commercial) software distribution provided
that you do not advertise this Package as a product of your own.

6.
The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as
output from the programs of this Package do not automatically fall
under the copyright of this Package, but belong to whomever generated
them, and may be sold commercially, and may be aggregated with this
Package.

7.Subroutines supplied by you and linked into this Package
shall not be considered part of this Package. 

8. The name of the
Copyright Holder may not be used to endorse or promote products
derived from this software without specific prior written
permission.

9. THIS PACKAGE IS PROVIDED ""AS IS"" AND WITHOUT ANY
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.

Public Domain or from the Copyright Holder. A Package modified in such
a way shall still be considered the Standard Version.

3. You may
otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way, provided that
you insert a prominent notice in each changed file stating how and
when you changed that file, and provided that you do at least ONE of
the following:

     a) place your modifications in the Public Domain
or otherwise make them Freely Available, such as by posting said
modifications to Usenet or an equivalent medium, or placing the
modifications on a major archive site such as uunet.uu.net, or by
allowing the Copyright Holder to include your modifications in the
Standard Version of the Package.

     b) use the modified Package
only within your corporation or organization.

     c) rename any
non-standard executables so the names do not conflict with standard
executables, which must also be provided, and provide a separate
manual page for each non-standard executable that clearly documents
how it differs from the Standard Version.

     d) make other
distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.

4. You may
distribute the programs of this Package in object code or executable
form, provided that you do at least ONE of the following:

     a)
distribute a Standard Version of the executables and library files,
together with instructions (in the manual page or equivalent) on where
to get the Standard Version.

     b) accompany the distribution with
the machine-readable source of the Package with your modifications.

 
   c) accompany any non-standard executables with their corresponding
Standard Version executables, giving the non-standard executables
non-standard names, and clearly documenting the differences in manual
pages (or equivalent), together with instructions on where to get the
Standard Version.

     d) make other distribution arrangements with
the Copyright Holder.

5. You may charge a reasonable copying fee for
any distribution of this Package. You may charge any fee you choose
for support of this Package. You may not charge a fee for this Package
itself. However, you may distribute this Package in aggregate with
other (possibly commercial) programs as part of a larger (possibly
commercial) software distribution provided that you do not advertise
this Package as a product of your own.

6. The scripts and library
files supplied as input to or produced as output from the programs of
this Package do not automatically fall under the copyright of this
Package, but belong to whomever generated them, and may be sold
commercially, and may be aggregated with this Package.

7. C
subroutines supplied by you and linked into this Package in order to
emulate subroutines and variables defined by this Package shall not be
considered part of this Package, but are the equivalent of input as in
Paragraph 6, provided these subroutines do not change the behavior of
the Package in any way that would cause it to fail the regression
tests for the Package.

8. Software supplied by you and linked with
this Package in order to use subroutines and variables defined by this
Package shall not be considered part of this Package and do not
automatically fall under the copyright of this Package. Executables
produced by linking your software with this Package may be used and
redistributed without restriction and may be sold commercially so long
as the primary function of your software is different than the package
itself.

9. The name of the Copyright Holder may not be used to

specific prior written permission.

3.
Distribution Obligations.

     3.1. Application of License. The
Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are governed
by the terms of this License, including without limitation Section
2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be distributed only
under the terms of this License or a future version of this License
released under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of this
License with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not
offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or
restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients'
rights hereunder. However, You may include an additional document
offering the additional rights described in Section 3.5.

     3.2.
Availability of Source Code. Any Modification which You create or to
which You contribute must be made available, prior to any use, except
for internal development and practice, in Source Code form under the
terms of this License either on the same media as an Executable
version or via an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone
to whom you made an Executable version available; and if made
available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must remain available
for at least twelve (12) months after the date it initially became
available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent version of
that particular Modification has been made available to such
recipients. You shall notify the Initial Developer of the Modification
and the location of the Source Code via the contact means provided for
in the Developer Specific license. Initial Developer will be acting as
maintainer of the Source Code and may provide an Electronic
Distribution mechanism for the Modification to be made available.

   
 3.3. Description of Modifications. You must cause all Covered Code to
which you contribute to contain a file documenting the changes You
made to create that Covered Code and the date of any change. You must
include a prominent statement that the Modification is derived,
directly or indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial
Developer and including the name of the Initial Developer in (a) the
Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version or related
documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership of the
Covered Code.

     3.4. Intellectual Property Matters

          (a)
Third Party Claims. If You have knowledge that a party claims an
intellectual property right in particular functionality or code (or
its utilization under this License), you must include a text file with
the source code distribution titled ""LEGAL"" which describes the claim
and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient
will know whom to contact. If you obtain such knowledge after You make
Your Modification available as described in Section 3.2, You shall
promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies You make available
thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate
mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who
received the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.

     
    (b) Representations. Contributor represents that, except as
disclosed pursuant to Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that
Contributor's Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s)
and/or Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed
by this License.

     3.5. Required Notices. You must duplicate the
notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code, and this License
in any documentation for the Source Code, where You describe
recipients' rights relating to Covered Code. If You created one or
more Modification(s), You may add your name as a Contributor to the
notice described in Exhibit A. If it is not possible to put such
notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then you
must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory
file) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice. You may
choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity
or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code.
However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of
the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely
clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability
obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify
the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred
by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty,
support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.

     3.6.
Distribution of Executable Versions. You may distribute Covered Code
in Executable form only if the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have
been met for that Covered Code, and if You include a notice stating
that the Source Code version of the Covered Code is available under
the terms of this License, including a description of how and where
You have fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be
conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable version, related
documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients' rights
relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable
version of Covered Code under a license of Your choice, which may
contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in
compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the
Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's
rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this
License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different
license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ
from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial
Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the
Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by
the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such
terms You offer. If you distribute executable versions containing
Covered Code, you must reproduce the notice in Exhibit B in the
documentation and/or other materials provided with the product.

    
3.7. Larger Works. You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered
Code with other code not governed by the terms of this License and
distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You
must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the
Covered Code.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or
Regulation.

If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the
terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code
due to statute or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms
of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) Cite all of
the statutes or regulations that prohibit you from complying fully
with this license. (c) describe the limitations and the code they
affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described
in Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the
Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation,
such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of
ordinary skill to be able to understand it.

5. Application of this
License.

This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer
has attached the notice in Exhibit A, and to related Covered Code.

6.
Versions of the License.

     6.1. New Versions. License Author may
publish revised and/or new versions of the License from time to time.
Each version will be given a distinguishing version number and shall
be submitted to opensource.org for certification.

     6.2. Effect of
New Versions. Once Covered Code has been published under a particular
version of the License, You may always continue to use it under the
terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code
under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by
Initial Developer. No one other than Initial Developer has the right
to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under this
License.

     6.3. Derivative Works. If you create or use a modified
version of this License, except in association with the required
Developer Specific License described in section 6.4, (which you may
only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code
governed by this License), you must (a) rename Your license so that
the phrases ``Open'', ``OpenPL'', ``OPL'' or any confusingly similar
phrase do not appear anywhere in your license and (b) otherwise make
it clear that your version of the license contains terms which differ
from the Open Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial
Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in
Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of
this License.)

     6.4. Required Additional Developer Specific
License
This license is a union of the following two parts that should
be found as text files in the same place (directory), in the order of
preeminence:

          [1] A Developer specific license.

         
[2] The contents of this file OPL_1_0.TXT, stating the general
licensing policy of the software.

In case of conflicting dispositions
in the parts of this license, the terms of the lower-numbered part
will always be superseded by the terms of the higher numbered
part.

7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.

COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS
LICENSE ON AN ""AS IS"" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER
EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT
THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE
QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY
COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL
DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY
SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY
CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED
CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

8.
TERMINATION.

     8.1 Termination upon Breach
This License and the
rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to
comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days
of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Code,
which are properly granted, shall survive any termination of this
License. Provisions that, by their nature, must remain in effect
beyond the termination of this License shall survive.

     8.2.
Termination Upon Litigation. If You initiate litigation by asserting a
patent infringement claim (excluding declatory judgment actions)
against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or
Contributor against whom You file such action is referred to as
""Participant"") alleging that:

          (a) such Participant's
Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then
any and all rights granted by such Participant to You under Sections
2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from
Participant terminate prospectively, unless if within 60 days after
receipt of notice You either: (i) agree in writing to pay Participant
a mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and future use
of Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your
litigation claim with respect to the Contributor Version against such
Participant. If within 60 days of notice, a reasonable royalty and
payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the
parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted
by Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically
terminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice period specified
above.

          (b) any software, hardware, or device, other than
such Participant's Contributor Version, directly or indirectly
infringes any patent, then any rights granted to You by such
Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as
of the date You first made, used, sold, distributed, or had made,
Modifications made by that Participant.

     8.3. If You assert a
patent infringement claim against Participant alleging that such
Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any
patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement)
prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the
reasonable value of the licenses granted by such Participant under
Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the
amount or value of any payment or license.

     8.4. In the event of
termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all end user license
agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been
validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to
termination shall survive termination.

9. LIMITATION OF
LIABILITY.

UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER
TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL THE INITIAL
DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE,
OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY OTHER
PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES
OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF
GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND
ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE
BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF
LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY
RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW
PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE
EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO
THAT EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

10. U.S.
GOVERNMENT END USERS.

The Covered Code is a ``commercial item,'' as
that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of
``commercial computer software'' and ``commercial computer software
documentation,'' as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept.
1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1
through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire

such Executable Form under the terms of this License, or sublicense it
under different terms, provided that the license for the Executable
Form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients’ rights in
the Source Code Form under this License.

     3.3 Distribution of a
Larger Work 
     You may create and distribute a Larger Work under
terms of Your choice, provided that You also comply with the
requirements of this License for the Covered Software. If the Larger
Work is a combination of Covered Software with a work governed by one
or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered Software is not
Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License permits You to
additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of such
Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at
their option, further distribute the Covered Software under the terms
of either this License or such Secondary License(s).

     3.4
Notices 
     You may not remove or alter the substance of any
license notices (including copyright notices, patent notices,
disclaimers of warranty, or limitations of liability) contained within
the Source Code Form of the Covered Software, except that You may
alter any license notices to the extent required to remedy known
factual inaccuracies.

     3.5 Application of Additional Terms

     
    3.5.1 You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty,
support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients
of Covered Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf,
and not on behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely
clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability
obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify
every Contributor for any liability incurred by such Contributor as a
result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.
You may include additional disclaimers of warranty and limitations of
liability specific to any jurisdiction.

          3.5.2 You may place
additional conditions upon the rights granted in this License to the
extent necessary due to statute, judicial order, regulation (including
without limitation state and federal procurement regulation), national
security, or public interest. Any such additional conditions must be
clearly described in the notice provisions required under Section 3.4.
 Any alteration of the terms of this License will apply to all copies
of the Covered Software distributed by You or by any downstream
recipients that receive the Covered Software from You.

4. Inability
to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
If it is impossible for You to
comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or
all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial order, or
regulation, then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License
to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and
the code they affect. Such description must be included in the notices
required under Section 3.4. Except to the extent prohibited by statute
or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a
recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.

5.
Termination

     5.1 Failure to Comply 
     The rights granted
under this License will terminate automatically if You fail to comply
with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant, then the
rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor are
reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor
explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing
basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance
by some reasonable means prior to 60-days after You have come back
into compliance.  Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor
are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of
the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the first time
You have received notice of non-compliance with this License from such
Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30-days after Your
receipt of the notice.

     5.2 Patent Infringement Claims 
     If
You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version
directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted
to You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under
Section 2.1 of this License shall terminate.

     5.3 Additional
Compliance Terms 
     Notwithstanding the foregoing in this Section
5, for purposes of this Section, if You breach Section 3.1
(Distribution of Source Form), Section 3.2 (Distribution of Executable
Form), Section 3.3 (Distribution of a Larger Work), or Section 3.4
(Notices), then becoming compliant as described in Section 5.1 must
also include, no later than 30 days after receipt by You of notice of
such violation by a Contributor, making the Covered Software available
in Source Code Form as required by this License on a publicly
available computer network for a period of no less than three (3)
years.

     5.4 Contributor Remedies 
     If You fail to comply
with the terms of this License and do not thereafter
become 
compliant in accordance with Section 5.1 and, if applicable,
Section 5.3, then each Contributor reserves its right, in addition to
any other rights it may have in law or in equity, to bring an action
seeking injunctive relief, or damages for willful copyright or patent
infringement (including without limitation damages for unjust
enrichment, where available under law), for all actions in violation
of rights that would otherwise have been granted under the terms of
this License.

     5.5 End User License Agreements 
     In the
event of termination under this Section 5, all end user license
agreements 
(excluding distributors and resellers), which have been
validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior
to termination shall survive termination.

6. Disclaimer of
Warranty
Covered Software is provided under this License on an “as
is” basis, without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied,
or statutory, including, without limitation, warranties that the
Covered Software is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a
particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as to the
quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You.  Should
any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You (not any
Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or
correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an 
essential
part of this License.  No use of any Covered Software is authorized
under this License except under this disclaimer.

7. Limitation of
Liability
Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether
tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any
Contributor, or anyone who distributes Covered Software as permitted
above, be liable to You for any direct, indirect, special, incidental,
or consequential damages of any character including, without
limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of goodwill, work stoppage,
computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial
damages or losses, even if such party shall have been informed of the
possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability shall not
apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such
party’s negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such
limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or
limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion
and limitation may not apply to You.

8. Litigation
Any litigation
relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of a
jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of
business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that
jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions.
Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party’s ability to bring
cross-claims or counter-claims.

9. Government Terms

     9.1
Commercial Item 
     The Covered Software is a “commercial
item,” as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995),
consisting of “commercial computer software” and “commercial
computer software documentation,” as such terms are used in 48
C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48
C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government
End Users acquire Covered Software with only those rights set forth
herein.
     
     9.2 No Sovereign Immunity 
     The U.S. federal
government and states that use or distribute Covered Software hereby
waive their sovereign immunity with respect to enforcement of the
provisions of this License.

     9.3 Choice of Law and Venue

       
  9.3.1 If You are a government of a state of the United States, or
Your use of the Covered Software is pursuant to a procurement contract
with such a state government, this License shall be governed by the
law of such state, excluding its conflict-of-law provisions, and the
adjudication of disputes relating to this License will be subject to
the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in
such state.
          9.3.2 If You are an agency of the United States
federal government, or Your use of the Covered Software is pursuant to
a procurement contract with such an agency, this License shall be
governed by federal law for all purposes, and the adjudication of
disputes relating to this License will be subject to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the federal courts located in Washington, 
D.C.
     
    9.3.3 You may alter the terms of this Section 9.3 for this License
as described in Section 3.5.2.

     9.4 Supremacy 
     This Section
9 is in lieu of, and supersedes, any other Federal Acquisition
Regulation, Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation, or other clause or
provision that addresses government rights in computer software under
this License.

10. Miscellaneous 

This License represents the
complete agreement concerning the subject matter hereof. If any
provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision
shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable.
Any law or regulation, which provides that the language of a contract
shall be construed against the drafter, shall not be used to construe
this License against a Contributor.

11. Versions of the License

    
11.1 New Versions 
The Open Source Election Technology Foundation
(“OSET”) (formerly known as the Open Source Digital Voting
Foundation) is the steward of this License. Except as provided in
Section 11.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to
modify or publish new versions of this License.  Each version will be
given a distinguishing version number.

     11.2 Effects of New
Versions 
You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of
the version of the License under which You originally received the
Covered Software, or under the terms of any subsequent version
published by the license steward.

     11.3 Modified Versions 
If
You create software not governed by this License, and You want to
create a new license for such software, You may create and use a
modified version of this License if You rename the license and remove
any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that
such modified license differs from this License).

     11.4
Distributing Source Code Form That is Incompatible With Secondary
Licenses 
If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is
Incompatible With Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version
of the License, the notice described in Exhibit B of this License must
be attached.

Work"") whose owner (the ""Licensor"") has placed the following notice
immediately following the copyright notice for the Original Work: 

  
  ""Licensed under the Open Software License version 1.0""

License
Terms

1) Grant of Copyright License. Licensor hereby grants You a

in copies;

     b) to prepare derivative works (""Derivative Works"")

shall be licensed under the Open Software License;

     d) to perform
the Original Work publicly; and

     e) to display the Original Work
publicly.

2) Grant of Patent License. Licensor hereby grants You a
world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual, non-sublicenseable
license, under patent claims owned or controlled by the Licensor that
are embodied in the Original Work as furnished by the Licensor
(""Licensed Claims"") to make, use, sell and offer for sale the Original
Work. Licensor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,
non-exclusive, perpetual, non-sublicenseable license under the
Licensed Claims to make, use, sell and offer for sale Derivative
Works.

3) Grant of Source Code License. The term ""Source Code"" means
the preferred form of the Original Work for making modifications to it
and all available documentation describing how to access and modify
the Original Work. Licensor hereby agrees to provide a
machine-readable copy of the Source Code of the Original Work along
with each copy of the Original Work that Licensor distributes.
Licensor reserves the right to satisfy this obligation by placing a
machine-readable copy of the Source Code in an information repository
reasonably calculated to permit inexpensive and convenient access by
You for as long as Licensor continues to distribute the Original Work,
and by publishing the address of that information repository in a
notice immediately following the copyright notice that applies to the
Original Work.

4) Exclusions From License Grant. Nothing in this
License shall be deemed to grant any rights to trademarks, copyrights,
patents, trade secrets or any other intellectual property of Licensor
except as expressly stated herein. No patent license is granted to
make, use, sell or offer to sell embodiments of any patent claims
other than the Licensed Claims defined in Section 2. No right is
granted to the trademarks of Licensor even if such marks are included
in the Original Work. Nothing in this License shall be interpreted to
prohibit Licensor from licensing under different terms from this
License any Original Work that Licensor otherwise would have a right
to license.

5) External Deployment. The term ""External Deployment""
means the use or distribution of the Original Work or Derivative Works
in any way such that the Original Work or Derivative Works may be
accessed or used by anyone other than You, whether the Original Work
or Derivative Works are distributed to those persons, made available
as an application intended for use over a computer network, or used to
provide services or otherwise deliver content to anyone other than
You. As an express condition for the grants of license hereunder, You
agree that any External Deployment by You shall be deemed a
distribution and shall be licensed to all under the terms of this
License, as prescribed in section 1(c) herein.

6) Warranty and
Disclaimer of Warranty. LICENSOR WARRANTS THAT THE COPYRIGHT IN AND TO
THE ORIGINAL WORK IS OWNED BY THE LICENSOR OR THAT THE ORIGINAL WORK
IS DISTRIBUTED BY LICENSOR UNDER A VALID CURRENT LICENSE FROM THE
COPYRIGHT OWNER. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY STATED IN THE IMMEDIATELY
PRECEEDING SENTENCE, THE ORIGINAL WORK IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE
ON AN ""AS IS"" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,
INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE WARRANTY OF NON-INFRINGEMENT AND
WARRANTIES THAT THE ORIGINAL WORK IS MERCHANTABLE OR FIT FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY OF THE ORIGINAL
WORK IS WITH YOU. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL
PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO LICENSE TO ORIGINAL WORK IS GRANTED HEREUNDER
EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

7) Limitation of Liability. UNDER NO
CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING
NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO

CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER ARISING AS A RESULT OF THIS
LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE ORIGINAL WORK INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR
MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN
IF SUCH PERSON SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR
DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE
EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO
NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

8)
Acceptance and Termination. Nothing else but this License (or another
written agreement between Licensor and You) grants You permission to
create Derivative Works based upon the Original Work, and any attempt
to do so except under the terms of this License (or another written
agreement between Licensor and You) is expressly prohibited by U.S.
copyright law, the equivalent laws of other countries, and by
international treaty. Therefore, by exercising any of the rights
granted to You in Sections 1 and 2 herein, You indicate Your
acceptance of this License and all of its terms and conditions. This
license shall terminate immediately and you may no longer exercise any
of the rights granted to You by this License upon Your failure to
honor the proviso in Section 1(c) herein.

9) Mutual Termination for
Patent Action. This License shall terminate automatically and You may
no longer exercise any of the rights granted to You by this License if
You file a lawsuit in any court alleging that any OSI Certified open
source software that is licensed under any license containing this
""Mutual Termination for Patent Action"" clause infringes any patent
claims that are essential to use that software.

10) Jurisdiction,
Venue and Governing Law. You agree that any lawsuit arising under or
relating to this License shall be maintained in the courts of the
jurisdiction wherein the Licensor resides or in which Licensor
conducts its primary business, and under the laws of that jurisdiction
excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. The application of the
United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of
Goods is expressly excluded. Any use of the Original Work outside the
scope of this License or after its termination shall be subject to the
requirements and penalties of the U.S. Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. § 101
et seq., the equivalent laws of other countries, and international
treaty. This section shall survive the termination of this
License.

section shall survive the termination of this License.

12)
Miscellaneous. This License represents the complete agreement
concerning the subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License
is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to
the extent necessary to make it enforceable.

13) Definition of ""You""

lower case, means an individual or a legal entity exercising rights

entities, ""You"" includes any entity that controls, is controlled by,
or is under common control with you. For purposes of this definition,

This Open Software License (the
""License"") applies to any original work of authorship (the ""Original
Work"") whose owner (the ""Licensor"") has placed the following notice
immediately following the copyright notice for the Original Work:

   
 Licensed under the Open Software License version 1.1 

1) Grant of
Copyright License. Licensor hereby grants You a world-wide,
royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual, non-sublicenseable license to

     a) to reproduce the Original Work in copies;


    b) to prepare derivative works (""Derivative Works"") based upon the

Work. Licensor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,
non-exclusive, perpetual, non-sublicenseable license under the
Licensed Claims to make, use, sell and offer for sale Derivative
Works.

3) Grant of Source Code License. The term ""Source Code"" means
the preferred form of the Original Work for making modifications to it
and all available documentation describing how to modify the Original
Work. Licensor hereby agrees to provide a machine-readable copy of the
Source Code of the Original Work along with each copy of the Original
Work that Licensor distributes. Licensor reserves the right to satisfy
this obligation by placing a machine-readable copy of the Source Code
in an information repository reasonably calculated to permit
inexpensive and convenient access by You for as long as Licensor
continues to distribute the Original Work, and by publishing the
address of that information repository in a notice immediately
following the copyright notice that applies to the Original Work. 

4)
Exclusions From License Grant. Nothing in this License shall be deemed
to grant any rights to trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets
or any other intellectual property of Licensor except as expressly
stated herein. No patent license is granted to make, use, sell or
offer to sell embodiments of any patent claims other than the Licensed
Claims defined in Section 2. No right is granted to the trademarks of
Licensor even if such marks are included in the Original Work. Nothing
in this License shall be interpreted to prohibit Licensor from
licensing under different terms from this License any Original Work
that Licensor otherwise would have a right to license.

5) External
Deployment. The term ""External Deployment"" means the use or
distribution of the Original Work or Derivative Works in any way such
that the Original Work or Derivative Works may be used by anyone other
than You, whether the Original Work or Derivative Works are
distributed to those persons or made available as an application

the grants of license hereunder, You agree that any External
Deployment by You of a Derivative Work shall be deemed a distribution
and shall be licensed to all under the terms of this License, as
prescribed in section 1(c) herein.

6) Attribution Rights. You must
retain, in the Source Code of any Derivative Works that You create,
all copyright, patent or trademark notices from the Source Code of the

text identified therein as an ""Attribution Notice."" You must cause the
Source Code for any Derivative Works that You create to carry a
prominent Attribution Notice reasonably calculated to inform
recipients that You have modified the Original Work.

7) Warranty and
Disclaimer of Warranty. Licensor warrants that the copyright in and to
the Original Work is owned by the Licensor or that the Original Work
is distributed by Licensor under a valid current license from the
copyright owner. Except as expressly stated in the immediately
proceeding sentence, the Original Work is provided under this License
on an ""AS IS"" BASIS and WITHOUT WARRANTY, either express or implied,
including, without limitation, the warranties of NON-INFRINGEMENT,

theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or
otherwise, shall the Licensor be liable to any person for any direct,
indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any
character arising as a result of this License or the use of the
Original Work including, without limitation, damages for loss of
goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and
all other commercial damages or losses. This limitation of liability
shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting
from Licensor's negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such
limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or
limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion
and limitation may not apply to You. 

9) Acceptance and Termination.
If You distribute copies of the Original Work or a Derivative Work,
You must make a reasonable effort under the circumstances to obtain
the express and volitional assent of recipients to the terms of this
License. Nothing else but this License (or another written agreement
between Licensor and You) grants You permission to create Derivative
Works based upon the Original Work or to exercise any of the rights
granted in Sections 1 herein, and any attempt to do so except under
the terms of this License (or another written agreement between

equivalent laws of other countries, and by international treaty.
Therefore, by exercising any of the rights granted to You in Sections
1 herein, You indicate Your acceptance of this License and all of its
terms and conditions. This License shall terminate immediately and you
may no longer exercise any of the rights granted to You by this
License upon Your failure to honor the proviso in Section 1(c)

terminate automatically and You may no longer exercise any of the
rights granted to You by this License if You file a lawsuit in any
court alleging that any OSI Certified open source software that is
licensed under any license containing this ""Mutual Termination for
Patent Action"" clause infringes any patent claims that are essential
to use that software.

11) Jurisdiction, Venue and Governing Law. Any
action or suit relating to this License may be brought only in the
courts of a jurisdiction wherein the Licensor resides or in which
Licensor conducts its primary business, and under the laws of that
jurisdiction excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. The application
of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International
Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any use of the Original Work
outside the scope of this License or after its termination shall be
subject to the requirements and penalties of the U.S. Copyright Act,
17 U.S.C. å¤ 101 et seq., the equivalent laws of other countries,
and international treaty. This section shall survive the termination
of this License.

terms of this License or seeking damages relating thereto, the
prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its costs and expenses,
including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and costs
incurred in connection with such action, including any appeal of such
action. This section shall survive the termination of this
License.

agreement concerning the subject matter hereof. If any provision of
this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be
reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable.

14)
Definition of ""You"" in This License. ""You"" throughout this License,
whether in upper or lower case, means an individual or a legal entity
exercising rights under, and complying with all of the terms of, this
License. For legal entities, ""You"" includes any entity that controls,

or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

restricted or conditioned by this License or by law, and Licensor
promises not to interfere with or be responsible for such uses by
You.

Work that Licensor distributes. Licensor reserves the right to satisfy
this obligation by placing a machine-readable copy of the Source Code
in an information repository reasonably calculated to permit
inexpensive and convenient access by You for as long as Licensor
continues to distribute the Original Work, and by publishing the
address of that information repository in a notice immediately
following the copyright notice that applies to the Original Work.

4)
Exclusions From License Grant. Neither the names of Licensor, nor the
names of any contributors to the Original Work, nor any of their
trademarks or service marks, may be used to endorse or promote
products derived from this Original Work without express prior written
permission of the Licensor. Nothing in this License shall be deemed to
grant any rights to trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets or
any other intellectual property of Licensor except as expressly stated
herein. No patent license is granted to make, use, sell or offer to
sell embodiments of any patent claims other than the licensed claims
defined in Section 2. No right is granted to the trademarks of
Licensor even if such marks are included in the Original Work. Nothing
in this License shall be interpreted to prohibit Licensor from
licensing under different terms from this License any Original Work
that Licensor otherwise would have a right to license.

5) External
Deployment. The term ""External Deployment"" means the use or
distribution of the Original Work or Derivative Works in any way such
that the Original Work or Derivative Works may be used by anyone other
than You, whether the Original Work or Derivative Works are
distributed to those persons or made available as an application
intended for use over a computer network. As an express condition for
the grants of license hereunder, You agree that any External
Deployment by You of a Derivative Work shall be deemed a distribution
and shall be licensed to all under the terms of this License, as
prescribed in section 1(c) herein.

6) Attribution Rights. You must
retain, in the Source Code of any Derivative Works that You create,
all copyright, patent or trademark notices from the Source Code of the
Original Work, as well as any notices of licensing and any descriptive
text identified therein as an ""Attribution Notice."" You must cause the
Source Code for any Derivative Works that You create to carry a
prominent Attribution Notice reasonably calculated to inform
recipients that You have modified the Original Work.

7) Warranty of
Provenance and Disclaimer of Warranty. Licensor warrants that the
copyright in and to the Original Work and the patent rights granted
herein by Licensor are owned by the Licensor or are sublicensed to You
under the terms of this License with the permission of the
contributor(s) of those copyrights and patent rights. Except as
expressly stated in the immediately proceeding sentence, the Original
Work is provided under this License on an ""AS IS"" BASIS and WITHOUT
WARRANTY, either express or implied, including, without limitation,
the warranties of NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY OF THE ORIGINAL
WORK IS WITH YOU. This DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY constitutes an essential
part of this License. No license to Original Work is granted hereunder
except under this disclaimer.

8) Limitation of Liability. Under no
circumstances and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including
negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall the Licensor be liable to
any person for any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or
consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this
License or the use of the Original Work including, without limitation,
damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or
malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses. This
limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or
personal injury resulting from Licensor's negligence to the extent
applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some jurisdictions do not
allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential
damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.

9)
Acceptance and Termination. If You distribute copies of the Original
Work or a Derivative Work, You must make a reasonable effort under the
circumstances to obtain the express assent of recipients to the terms
of this License. Nothing else but this License (or another written
agreement between Licensor and You) grants You permission to create
Derivative Works based upon the Original Work or to exercise any of
the rights granted in Section 1 herein, and any attempt to do so
except under the terms of this License (or another written agreement
between Licensor and You) is expressly prohibited by U.S. copyright
law, the equivalent laws of other countries, and by international
treaty. Therefore, by exercising any of the rights granted to You in
Section 1 herein, You indicate Your acceptance of this License and all
of its terms and conditions. This License shall terminate immediately
and you may no longer exercise any of the rights granted to You by
this License upon Your failure to honor the proviso in Section 1(c)
herein.

10) Termination for Patent Action. This License shall
terminate automatically and You may no longer exercise any of the
rights granted to You by this License as of the date You commence an
action, including a cross-claim or counterclaim, for patent
infringement (i) against Licensor with respect to a patent applicable
to software or (ii) against any entity with respect to a patent
applicable to the Original Work (but excluding combinations of the
Original Work with other software or hardware).

11) Jurisdiction,
Venue and Governing Law. Any action or suit relating to this License
may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction wherein the
Licensor resides or in which Licensor conducts its primary business,
and under the laws of that jurisdiction excluding its conflict-of-law
provisions. The application of the United Nations Convention on
Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.
Any use of the Original Work outside the scope of this License or
after its termination shall be subject to the requirements and
penalties of the U.S. Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. 101 et seq., the
equivalent laws of other countries, and international treaty. This
section shall survive the termination of this License.

12) Attorneys
Fees. In any action to enforce the terms of this License or seeking
damages relating thereto, the prevailing party shall be entitled to
recover its costs and expenses, including, without limitation,
reasonable attorneys' fees and costs incurred in connection with such
action, including any appeal of such action. This section shall
survive the termination of this License.

13) Miscellaneous. This
License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject
matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
necessary to make it enforceable.

14) Definition of ""You"" in This
License. ""You"" throughout this License, whether in upper or lower
case, means an individual or a legal entity exercising rights under,
and complying with all of the terms of, this License. For legal
entities, ""You"" includes any entity that controls, is controlled by,
or is under common control with you. For purposes of this definition,
""control"" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

15)
Right to Use. You may use the Original Work in all ways not otherwise
restricted or conditioned by this License or by law, and Licensor
promises not to interfere with or be responsible for such uses by
You.

This Open Software License (the
""License"") applies to any original work of authorship (the ""Original
Work"") whose owner (the ""Licensor"") has placed the following notice
immediately following the copyright notice for the Original Work:

   
 Licensed under the Open Software License version 2.1

1) Grant of
Copyright License. Licensor hereby grants You a world-wide,
royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual, sublicenseable license to do
the following:

     a) to reproduce the Original Work in copies;

   
 b) to prepare derivative works (""Derivative Works"") based upon the

publicly.

2) Grant of Patent License. Licensor hereby grants You a
world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual, sublicenseable
license, under patent claims owned or controlled by the Licensor that
are embodied in the Original Work as furnished by the Licensor, to
make, use, sell and offer for sale the Original Work and Derivative
Works.

3) Grant of Source Code License. The term ""Source Code"" means
the preferred form of the Original Work for making modifications to it
and all available documentation describing how to modify the Original
Work. Licensor hereby agrees to provide a machine-readable copy of the
Source Code of the Original Work along with each copy of the Original
Work that Licensor distributes. Licensor reserves the right to satisfy
this obligation by placing a machine-readable copy of the Source Code
in an information repository reasonably calculated to permit
inexpensive and convenient access by You for as long as Licensor
continues to distribute the Original Work, and by publishing the
address of that information repository in a notice immediately
following the copyright notice that applies to the Original Work.

4)
Exclusions From License Grant. Neither the names of Licensor, nor the
names of any contributors to the Original Work, nor any of their
trademarks or service marks, may be used to endorse or promote
products derived from this Original Work without express prior written
permission of the Licensor. Nothing in this License shall be deemed to
grant any rights to trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets or
any other intellectual property of Licensor except as expressly stated
herein. No patent license is granted to make, use, sell or offer to
sell embodiments of any patent claims other than the licensed claims
defined in Section 2. No right is granted to the trademarks of
Licensor even if such marks are included in the Original Work. Nothing
in this License shall be interpreted to prohibit Licensor from
licensing under different terms from this License any Original Work
that Licensor otherwise would have a right to license.

5) External
Deployment. The term ""External Deployment"" means the use or
distribution of the Original Work or Derivative Works in any way such
that the Original Work or Derivative Works may be used by anyone other
than You, whether the Original Work or Derivative Works are
distributed to those persons or made available as an application
intended for use over a computer network. As an express condition for
the grants of license hereunder, You agree that any External
Deployment by You of a Derivative Work shall be deemed a distribution
and shall be licensed to all under the terms of this License, as
prescribed in section 1(c) herein.

6) Attribution Rights. You must
retain, in the Source Code of any Derivative Works that You create,
all copyright, patent or trademark notices from the Source Code of the
Original Work, as well as any notices of licensing and any descriptive
text identified therein as an ""Attribution Notice."" You must cause the
Source Code for any Derivative Works that You create to carry a
prominent Attribution Notice reasonably calculated to inform
recipients that You have modified the Original Work.

7) Warranty of
Provenance and Disclaimer of Warranty. Licensor warrants that the
copyright in and to the Original Work and the patent rights granted
herein by Licensor are owned by the Licensor or are sublicensed to You
under the terms of this License with the permission of the
contributor(s) of those copyrights and patent rights. Except as
expressly stated in the immediately proceeding sentence, the Original
Work is provided under this License on an ""AS IS"" BASIS and WITHOUT
WARRANTY, either express or implied, including, without limitation,
the warranties of NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY OF THE ORIGINAL
WORK IS WITH YOU. This DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY constitutes an essential
part of this License. No license to Original Work is granted hereunder
except under this disclaimer.

8) Limitation of Liability. Under no
circumstances and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including
negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall the Licensor be liable to
any person for any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or
consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this
License or the use of the Original Work including, without limitation,
damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or
malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses. This
limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or
personal injury resulting from Licensor's negligence to the extent
applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some jurisdictions do not
allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential
damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.

9)
Acceptance and Termination. If You distribute copies of the Original
Work or a Derivative Work, You must make a reasonable effort under the
circumstances to obtain the express assent of recipients to the terms
of this License. Nothing else but this License (or another written
agreement between Licensor and You) grants You permission to create
Derivative Works based upon the Original Work or to exercise any of
the rights granted in Section 1 herein, and any attempt to do so
except under the terms of this License (or another written agreement
between Licensor and You) is expressly prohibited by U.S. copyright
law, the equivalent laws of other countries, and by international
treaty. Therefore, by exercising any of the rights granted to You in
Section 1 herein, You indicate Your acceptance of this License and all
of its terms and conditions. This License shall terminate immediately
and you may no longer exercise any of the rights granted to You by
this License upon Your failure to honor the proviso in Section 1(c)
herein.

10) Termination for Patent Action. This License shall
terminate automatically and You may no longer exercise any of the
rights granted to You by this License as of the date You commence an
action, including a cross-claim or counterclaim, against Licensor or
any licensee alleging that the Original Work infringes a patent. This
termination provision shall not apply for an action alleging patent
infringement by combinations of the Original Work with other software
or hardware.

11) Jurisdiction, Venue and Governing Law. Any action or
suit relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of a
jurisdiction wherein the Licensor resides or in which Licensor
conducts its primary business, and under the laws of that jurisdiction
excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. The application of the
United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of
Goods is expressly excluded. Any use of the Original Work outside the
scope of this License or after its termination shall be subject to the
requirements and penalties of the U.S. Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. ¤ 101
et seq., the equivalent laws of other countries, and international
treaty. This section shall survive the termination of this
License.

12) Attorneys Fees. In any action to enforce the terms of
this License or seeking damages relating thereto, the prevailing party
shall be entitled to recover its costs and expenses, including,
without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and costs incurred in
connection with such action, including any appeal of such action. This
section shall survive the termination of this License.

13)
Miscellaneous. This License represents the complete agreement
concerning the subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License
is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to
the extent necessary to make it enforceable.

14) Definition of ""You""

lower case, means an individual or a legal entity exercising rights

Right to Use. You may use the Original Work in all ways not otherwise
restricted or conditioned by this License or by law, and Licensor
promises not to interfere with or be responsible for such uses by
You.

Original Work and Derivative Works.

3) Grant of Source Code License.
The term ""Source Code"" means the preferred form of the Original Work
for making modifications to it and all available documentation
describing how to modify the Original Work. Licensor agrees to provide
a machine-readable copy of the Source Code of the Original Work along
with each copy of the Original Work that Licensor distributes.
Licensor reserves the right to satisfy this obligation by placing a
machine-readable copy of the Source Code in an information repository
reasonably calculated to permit inexpensive and convenient access by
You for as long as Licensor continues to distribute the Original
Work.

4) Exclusions From License Grant. Neither the names of
Licensor, nor the names of any contributors to the Original Work, nor
any of their trademarks or service marks, may be used to endorse or
promote products derived from this Original Work without express prior
permission of the Licensor. Except as expressly stated herein, nothing
in this License grants any license to Licensor’s trademarks,
copyrights, patents, trade secrets or any other intellectual property.
No patent license is granted to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have
made, or import embodiments of any patent claims other than the

Licensor from licensing under terms different from this License any
Original Work that Licensor otherwise would have a right to
license.

5) External Deployment. The term ""External Deployment"" means
the use, distribution, or communication of the Original Work or
Derivative Works in any way such that the Original Work or Derivative

copyright in and to the Original Work and the patent rights granted
herein by Licensor are owned by the Licensor or are sublicensed to You
under the terms of this License with the permission of the
contributor(s) of those copyrights and patent rights. Except as
expressly stated in the immediately preceding sentence, the Original
Work is provided under this License on an ""AS IS"" BASIS and WITHOUT
WARRANTY, either express or implied, including, without limitation,
the warranties of non-infringement, merchantability or fitness for a

your clear and irrevocable acceptance of this License and all of its
terms and conditions. If You distribute or communicate copies of the
Original Work or a Derivative Work, You must make a reasonable effort
under the circumstances to obtain the express assent of recipients to
the terms of this License. This License conditions your rights to
undertake the activities listed in Section 1, including your right to
create Derivative Works based upon the Original Work, and doing so
without honoring these terms and conditions is prohibited by copyright
law and international treaty. Nothing in this License is intended to
affect copyright exceptions and limitations (including “fair use”
or “fair dealing”). This License shall terminate immediately and
You may no longer exercise any of the rights granted to You by this
License upon your failure to honor the conditions in Section
1(c).

(PDDL)

Preamble 
The Open Data Commons - Public Domain Dedication &
Licence is a document intended to allow you to freely share, modify,
and use this work for any purpose and without any restrictions. This
licence is intended for use on databases or their contents (""data""),
either together or individually.

Many databases are covered by
copyright. Some jurisdictions, mainly in Europe, have specific special
rights that cover databases called the ""sui generis"" database right.
Both of these sets of rights, as well as other legal rights used to
protect databases and data, can create uncertainty or practical
difficulty for those wishing to share databases and their underlying
data but retain a limited amount of rights under a ""some rights
reserved"" approach to licensing as outlined in the Science Commons
Protocol for Implementing Open Access Data. As a result, this waiver
and licence tries to the fullest extent possible to eliminate or fully
license any rights that cover this database and data. Any Community
Norms or similar statements of use of the database or data do not form
a part of this document, and do not act as a contract for access or
other terms of use for the database or data.

The position of the
recipient of the work

Because this document places the database and
its contents in or as close as possible within the public domain,
there are no restrictions or requirements placed on the recipient by
this document. Recipients may use this work commercially, use
technical protection measures, combine this data or database with
other databases or data, and share their changes and additions or keep
them secret. It is not a requirement that recipients provide further
users with a copy of this licence or attribute the original creator of
the data or database as a source. The goal is to eliminate
restrictions held by the original creator of the data and database on
the use of it by others.

The position of the dedicator of the
work

Copyright law, as with most other law under the banner of
""intellectual property"", is inherently national law. This means that
there exists several differences in how copyright and other IP rights
can be relinquished, waived or licensed in the many legal
jurisdictions of the world. This is despite much harmonisation of
minimum levels of protection. The internet and other communication
technologies span these many disparate legal jurisdictions and thus
pose special difficulties for a document relinquishing and waiving
intellectual property rights, including copyright and database rights,
for use by the global community. Because of this feature of
intellectual property law, this document first relinquishes the rights
and waives the relevant rights and claims. It then goes on to license
these same rights for jurisdictions or areas of law that may make it
difficult to relinquish or waive rights or claims.

The purpose of
this document is to enable rightsholders to place their work into the
public domain. Unlike licences for free and open source software, free
cultural works, or open content licences, rightsholders will not be
able to ""dual license"" their work by releasing the same work under
different licences. This is because they have allowed anyone to use
the work in whatever way they choose. Rightsholders therefore can’t
re-license it under copyright or database rights on different terms
because they have nothing left to license. Doing so creates truly
accessible data to build rich applications and advance the progress of
science and the arts.

This document can cover either or both of the
database and its contents (the data). Because databases can have a
wide variety of content - not just factual data - rightsholders should
use the Open Data Commons - Public Domain Dedication & Licence for an
entire database and its contents only if everything can be placed
under the terms of this document. Because even factual data can
sometimes have intellectual property rights, rightsholders should use
this licence to cover both the database and its factual data when
making material available under this document; even if it is likely
that the data would not be covered by copyright or database
rights.

Rightsholders can also use this document to cover any
copyright or database rights claims over only a database, and leave
the contents to be covered by other licences or documents. They can do
this because this document refers to the ""Work"", which can be either -
or both - the database and its contents. As a result, rightsholders
need to clearly state what they are dedicating under this document
when they dedicate it.

Just like any licence or other document
dealing with intellectual property, rightsholders should be aware that
one can only license what one owns. Please ensure that the rights have
been cleared to make this material available under this
document.

This document permanently and irrevocably makes the Work
available to the public for any use of any kind, and it should not be
used unless the rightsholder is prepared for this to happen.

Part I:
Introduction

The Rightsholder (the Person holding rights or claims
over the Work) agrees as follows:

1.0 Definitions of Capitalised

2.0 What this
document covers

2.1. Legal effect of this Document. This Document
is:

     a. A dedication to the public domain and waiver of Copyright
and Database Rights over the Work; and

     b. A licence of Copyright
and Database Rights over the Work in jurisdictions that do not allow
for relinquishment or waiver.

2.2. Legal rights covered.

     a.
Copyright. Any copyright or neighbouring rights in the Work. Copyright
law varies between jurisdictions, but is likely to cover: the Database
model or schema, which is the structure, arrangement, and organisation
of the Database, and can also include the Database tables and table
indexes; the data entry and output sheets; and the Field names of Data
stored in the Database. Copyright may also cover the Data depending on
the jurisdiction and type of Data; and

     b. Database Rights.
Database Rights only extend to the extraction and re-utilisation of
the whole or a substantial part of the Data. Database Rights can apply
even when there is no copyright over the Database. Database Rights can
also apply when the Data is removed from the Database and is selected
and arranged in a way that would not infringe any applicable
copyright.

2.2 Rights not covered.

     a. This Document does not
apply to computer programs used in the making or operation of the
Database;

     b. This Document does not cover any patents over the
Data or the Database. Please see Section 4.2 later in this Document
for further details; and

     c. This Document does not cover any
trade marks associated with the Database. Please see Section 4.3 later
in this Document for further details.

Users of this Database are
cautioned that they may have to clear other rights or consult other
licences.

2.3 Facts are free. The Rightsholder takes the position
that factual information is not covered by Copyright. This Document
however covers the Work in jurisdictions that may protect the factual
information in the Work by Copyright, and to cover any information
protected by Copyright that is contained in the Work.

Part II:
Dedication to the public domain

3.0 Dedication, waiver, and licence
of Copyright and Database Rights

3.1 Dedication of Copyright and
Database Rights to the public domain. The Rightsholder by using this
Document, dedicates the Work to the public domain for the benefit of
the public and relinquishes all rights in Copyright and Database
Rights over the Work.

     a. The Rightsholder realises that once
these rights are relinquished, that the Rightsholder has no further
rights in Copyright and Database Rights over the Work, and that the
Work is free and open for others to Use.

     b. The Rightsholder
intends for their relinquishment to cover all present and future
rights in the Work under Copyright and Database Rights, whether they
are vested or contingent rights, and that this relinquishment of
rights covers all their heirs and successors.

The above
relinquishment of rights applies worldwide and includes media and
formats now known or created in the future.

3.2 Waiver of rights and
claims in Copyright and Database Rights when Section 3.1 dedication
inapplicable. If the dedication in Section 3.1 does not apply in the
relevant jurisdiction under Section 6.4, the Rightsholder waives any
rights and claims that the Rightsholder may have or acquire in the
future over the Work in:

     a. Copyright; and

     b. Database
Rights.

To the extent possible in the relevant jurisdiction, the
above waiver of rights and claims applies worldwide and includes media
and formats now known or created in the future. The Rightsholder
agrees not to assert the above rights and waives the right to enforce
them over the Work.

3.3 Licence of Copyright and Database Rights when
Sections 3.1 and 3.2 inapplicable. If the dedication and waiver in
Sections 3.1 and 3.2 does not apply in the relevant jurisdiction under
Section 6.4, the Rightsholder and You agree as follows:

     a. The
Licensor grants to You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive,
licence to Use the Work for the duration of any applicable Copyright
and Database Rights. These rights explicitly include commercial use,
and do not exclude any field of endeavour. To the extent possible in
the relevant jurisdiction, these rights may be exercised in all media
and formats whether now known or created in the future.

3.4 Moral
rights. This section covers moral rights, including the right to be
identified as the author of the Work or to object to treatment that
would otherwise prejudice the author’s honour and reputation, or any
other derogatory treatment:

     a. For jurisdictions allowing waiver
of moral rights, Licensor waives all moral rights that Licensor may
have in the Work to the fullest extent possible by the law of the
relevant jurisdiction under Section 6.4;

     b. If waiver of moral
rights under Section 3.4 a in the relevant jurisdiction is not
possible, Licensor agrees not to assert any moral rights over the Work
and waives all claims in moral rights to the fullest extent possible
by the law of the relevant jurisdiction under Section 6.4; and

    
c. For jurisdictions not allowing waiver or an agreement not to assert
moral rights under Section 3.4 a and b, the author may retain their
moral rights over the copyrighted aspects of the Work.

Please note
that some jurisdictions do not allow for the waiver of moral rights,
and so moral rights may still subsist over the work in some
jurisdictions.

4.0 Relationship to other rights

4.1 No other
contractual conditions. The Rightsholder makes this Work available to
You without any other contractual obligations, either express or
implied. Any Community Norms statement associated with the Work is not
a contract and does not form part of this Document.

4.2 Relationship
to patents. This Document does not grant You a licence for any patents
that the Rightsholder may own. Users of this Database are cautioned
that they may have to clear other rights or consult other
licences.

4.3 Relationship to trade marks. This Document does not
grant You a licence for any trade marks that the Rightsholder may own
or that the Rightsholder may use to cover the Work. Users of this
Database are cautioned that they may have to clear other rights or
consult other licences. Part III: General provisions

5.0 Warranties,
disclaimer, and limitation of liability

5.1 The Work is provided by
the Rightsholder ""as is"" and without any warranty of any kind, either
express or implied, whether of title, of accuracy or completeness, of
the presence of absence of errors, of fitness for purpose, or
otherwise. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of implied
warranties, so this exclusion may not apply to You.

5.2 Subject to
any liability that may not be excluded or limited by law, the
Rightsholder is not liable for, and expressly excludes, all liability
for loss or damage however and whenever caused to anyone by any use
under this Document, whether by You or by anyone else, and whether
caused by any fault on the part of the Rightsholder or not. This
exclusion of liability includes, but is not limited to, any special,
incidental, consequential, punitive, or exemplary damages. This
exclusion applies even if the Rightsholder has been advised of the
possibility of such damages.

5.3 If liability may not be excluded by
law, it is limited to actual and direct financial loss to the extent
it is caused by proved negligence on the part of the
Rightsholder.

2. SOURCE CODE LICENSE

     2.1. The Initial Developer
Grant. The Initial Developer hereby grants You a world-wide,
royalty-free, non-exclusive license, subject to third party
intellectual property claims:

          (a) to use, reproduce,
modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute the Original Code
(or portions thereof) with or without Modifications, or as part of a
Larger Work; and

          (b) under patents now or hereafter owned
or controlled by Initial Developer, to make, have made, use and sell
(""Utilize"") the Original Code (or portions thereof), but solely to the
extent that any such patent is reasonably necessary to enable You to
Utilize the Original Code (or portions thereof) and not to any greater
extent that may be necessary to Utilize further Modifications or
combinations.

     2.2. Contributor Grant. Each Contributor hereby
grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license, subject
to third party intellectual property claims:

          (a) to use,
reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute the
Modifications created by such Contributor (or portions thereof) either
on an unmodified basis, with other Modifications, as Covered Code or
as part of a Larger Work; and

          (b) under patents now or
hereafter owned or controlled by Contributor, to Utilize the
Contributor Version (or portions thereof), but solely to the extent
that any such patent is reasonably necessary to enable You to Utilize
the Contributor Version (or portions thereof), and not to any greater
extent that may be necessary to Utilize further Modifications or
combinations.

3. DISTRIBUTION OBLIGATIONS

     3.1. Application of
License. The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute
are governed by the terms of this License, including without
limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be
distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version
of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a
copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You
distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code
version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this
License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include
an additional document offering the additional rights described in
Section 3.5.

     3.2. Availability of Source Code. Any Modification
which You create or to which You contribute must be made available in
Source Code form under the terms of this License via an accepted
Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an
Executable version available and to the Initial Developer; and if made
available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must remain available
for at least twelve (12) months after the date it initially became
available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent version of
that particular Modification has been made available to such
recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code
version remains available even if the Electronic Distribution
Mechanism is maintained by a third party. You are responsible for
notifying the Initial Developer of the Modification and the location
of the Source if a contact means is provided. Red Hat will be acting
as maintainer of the Source and may provide an Electronic Distribution
mechanism for the Modification to be made available. You can contact
Red Hat to make the Modification available and to notify the Initial
Developer. (http://sourceware.cygnus.com/ecos/)

     3.3. Description
of Modifications. You must cause all Covered Code to which you
contribute to contain a file documenting the changes You made to
create that Covered Code and the date of any change. You must include
a prominent statement that the Modification is derived, directly or
indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial Developer and
including the name of the Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code,
and (b) in any notice in an Executable version or related
documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership of the
Covered Code.

     3.4. Intellectual Property Matters

          (a)
Third Party Claims.  If You have knowledge that a party claims an
intellectual property right in particular functionality or code (or
its utilization under this License), you must include a text file with
the source code distribution titled ""LEGAL"" which describes the claim
and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient
will know whom to contact. If you obtain such knowledge after You make
Your Modification available as described in Section 3.2, You shall
promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies You make available
thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate
mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who
received the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.

     
    (b) Contributor APIs. If Your Modification is an application
programming interface and You own or control patents which are
reasonably necessary to implement that API, you must also include this
information in the LEGAL file.

     3.5. Required Notices. You must
duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code, and
this License in any documentation for the Source Code, where You
describe recipients' rights relating to Covered Code. If You created
one or more Modification(s), You may add your name as a Contributor to
the Source Code. If it is not possible to put such notice in a
particular Source Code file due to its structure, then you must
include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory file)
where a user would be likely to look for such a notice. You may choose
to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or
liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code.

    
However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of
the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely
clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability
obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify
the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred
by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty,
support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.

     3.6.
Distribution of Executable Versions. You may distribute Covered Code
in Executable form only if the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have
been met for that Covered Code, and if You include a notice stating
that the Source Code version of the Covered Code is available under
the terms of this License, including a description of how and where
You have fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be
conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable version, related
documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients' rights
relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable
version of Covered Code under a license of Your choice, which may
contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in
compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the
Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's
rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this
License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different
license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ
from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial
Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the
Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by
the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such
terms You offer.

     If you distribute executable versions
containing Covered Code, you must reproduce the notice in Exhibit B in
the documentation and/or other materials provided with the product.

 
   3.7. Larger Works. You may create a Larger Work by combining
Covered Code with other code not governed by the terms of this License
and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case,
You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for
the Covered Code.

4. INABILITY TO COMPLY DUE TO STATUTE OR
REGULATION

If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the
terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code
due to statute or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms
of this License to the maximum extent possible; (b) cite the statute
or regulation that prohibits you from adhering to the license; and (c)
describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description
must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must
be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the
extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be
sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to
understand it. You must submit this LEGAL file to Red Hat for review,
and You will not be able use the covered code in any means until
permission is granted from Red Hat to allow for the inability to
comply due to statute or regulation.

5. APPLICATION OF THIS
LICENSE

This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer
has attached the notice in Exhibit A, and to related Covered
Code.

Red Hat may include Covered Code in products without such
additional products becoming subject to the terms of this License, and
may license such additional products on different terms from those
contained in this License.

Red Hat may license the Source Code of Red
Hat Branded Code without Red Hat Branded Code becoming subject to the
terms of this License, and may license Red Hat Branded Code on
different terms from those contained in this License. Contact Red Hat
for details of alternate licensing terms available.

6. VERSIONS OF
THE LICENSE

     6.1. New Versions. Red Hat may publish revised
and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version
will be given a distinguishing version number.

     6.2. Effect of
New Versions. Once Covered Code has been published under a particular
version of the License, You may always continue to use it under the
terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code
under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by
Red Hat. No one other than Red Hat has the right to modify the terms
applicable to Covered Code beyond what is granted under this and
subsequent Licenses.

     6.3. Derivative Works. If you create or use
a modified version of this License (which you may only do in order to
apply it to code which is not already Covered Code governed by this
License), you must (a) rename Your license so that the phrases ""ECOS"",
""eCos"", ""Red Hat"", ""RHEPL"" or any confusingly similar phrase do not
appear anywhere in your license and (b) otherwise make it clear that
your version of the license contains terms which differ from the Red
Hat eCos Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial
Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in
Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of
this License.)

7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY

COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED
UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN ""AS IS"" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES
THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE
QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY
COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL
DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY
SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY
CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED
CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

8.
TERMINATION

This License and the rights granted hereunder will
terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and
fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the
breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted
shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by
their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this
License shall survive.

9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

UNDER NO
CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING
NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY
OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER
OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY OTHER PERSON FOR ANY
INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY
CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL,
WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER
COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN
INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF
LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY
RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW
PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE
EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO
THAT EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

10. U.S.
GOVERNMENT END USERS

The Covered Code is a ""commercial item,"" as that
term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of
""commercial computer software"" and ""commercial computer software
documentation,"" as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept.
1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1
through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire
Covered Code with only those rights set forth herein.

11.

the losing party responsible for costs, including without limitation,
court costs and reasonable attorneys fees and expenses. The
application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the
International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or
regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be
construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License.

12.
RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS

has failed to comply with Section 3.4, You are responsible for damages
arising, directly or indirectly, out of Your utilization of rights
under this License, based on the number of copies of Covered Code you
made available, the revenues you received from utilizing such rights,
and other relevant factors. You agree to work with affected parties to
distribute responsibility on an equitable basis.

13. ADDITIONAL TERMS

In fact, it's not possible to own a

and performance of SAX is with you. Should SAX prove defective, you
assume the cost of all necessary servicing, repair or correction.

In
no event unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing
will any copyright holder, or any other party who may modify and/or
redistribute SAX, be liable to you for damages, including any general,
special, incidental or consequential damages arising out of the use or
inability to use SAX (including but not limited to loss of data or
data being rendered inaccurate or losses sustained by you or third
parties or a failure of the SAX to operate with any other programs),
even if such holder or other party has been advised of the possibility
of such damages.

claims: 
     (a) under intellectual property rights (other than
patent or trademark) Licensable by Initial Developer to use,
reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute the
Original Code (or portions thereof) with or without Modifications,
and/or as part of a Larger Work; and 
     (b) under Patents Claims
infringed by the making, using or selling of Original Code, to make,
have made, use, practice, sell, and offer for sale, and/or otherwise
dispose of the Original Code (or portions thereof). 
     (c) the
licenses granted in this Section 2.1(a) and (b) are effective on the

of this License. 
     (d) Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no
patent license is granted: 1) for code that You delete from the
Original Code; 2) separate from the Original Code; or 3) for
infringements caused by: i) the modification of the Original Code or
ii) the combination of the Original Code with other software or
devices.

property claims, each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide,
royalty-free, non-exclusive license 
     (a) under intellectual
property rights (other than patent or trademark) Licensable by

and distribute the Modifications created by such Contributor (or
portions thereof) either on an unmodified basis, with other
Modifications, as Covered Code and/or as part of a Larger Work; and 
 
   (b) under Patent Claims infringed by the making, using, or selling

Modifications made by that Contributor with other software (except as
part of the Contributor Version) or other devices; or 4) under Patent
Claims infringed by Covered Code in the absence of Modifications made
by that Contributor.

3. Distribution Obligations.

3.1 Application of
License. The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute
are governed by the terms of this License, including without
limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be
distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version
of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a
copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You
distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code
version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this
License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include
an additional document offering the additional rights described in
Section 3.5.  

3.2 Availability of Source Code. Any Modification
which You create or to which You contribute must be made available in
Source Code form under the terms of this License either on the same
media as an Executable version or via an accepted Electronic
Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable
version available; and if made available via Electronic Distribution
Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after
the date it initially became available, or at least six (6) months
after a subsequent version of that particular Modification has been
made available to such recipients. You are responsible for ensuring
that the Source Code version remains available even if the Electronic
Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.  

3.3
Description of Modifications. You must cause all Covered Code to which
You contribute to contain a file documenting the changes You made to
create that Covered Code and the date of any change. You must include
a prominent statement that the Modification is derived, directly or
indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial Developer and
including the name of the Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code,
and (b) in any notice in an Executable version or related
documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership of the
Covered Code.  

3.4 Intellectual Property Matters. 
     (a) Third
Party Claims. If Contributor has actual knowledge that a license under
a third party's intellectual property rights is required to exercise
the rights granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2,
Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code distribution
titled ""LEGAL"" which describes the claim and the party making the
claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact.
If Contributor obtains such knowledge after the Modification is made
available as described in Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly
modify the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor makes available
thereafter. 
     (b) Contributor API's. If Contributor's
Modifications include an application programming interface and
Contributor has actual knowledge of patent licenses which are
reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must also
include this information in the LEGAL file. 
     (c) Representations.
Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section
3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's Modifications
are Contributor's original creation(s) and/or Contributor has
sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.  

3.5
Required Notices. You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each
file of the Source Code. If it is not possible to put such notice in a
particular Source Code file due to its structure, then You must
include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory) where
a user would be most likely to look for such a notice. If You created
one or more Modification(s) You may add your name as a Contributor to
the notice described in Exhibit A. You must also duplicate this
License in any documentation for the Source Code where You describe
recipients' rights or ownership rights relating to Covered Code. You
may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of
Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not
on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make
it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or
liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to
indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any
liability (excluding any liability arising from intellectual property
claims relating to the Covered Code) incurred by the Initial Developer
or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or
liability terms You offer.  

3.6 Distribution of Executable Versions.
You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the
requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code,
and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of
the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License,
including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the
obligation of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included
in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or
collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the
Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered
Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may
contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in
compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the
Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's
rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this
License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different
license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ
from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial
Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the
Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability (excluding
any liability arising from intellectual property claims relating to
the Covered Code) incurred by the Initial Developer or such
Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.  

3.7 Larger
Works. You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with
other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute
the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make
sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered
Code.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation. If it is
impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License
with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute,
judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms
of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the
limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be
included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must be
included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the
extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be
sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to
understand it.

5. Application of this License. This License applies
to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the notice in
Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.

6. Versions of the
License.

6.1 New Versions. The Storage Networking Industry
Association (the ""SNIA"") may publish revised and/or new versions of
the License from time to time. Each version will be given a
distinguishing version number.  

6.2 Effect of New Versions. Once
Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the
License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that
version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms
of any subsequent version of the License published by the SNIA. No one
other than the SNIA has the right to modify the terms applicable to
Covered Code created under this License.  

6.3 Derivative Works. If
You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may
only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code
governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your license so that
the phrases ""Storage Networking Industry Association,"" ""SNIA,"" or any
confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your license (except to
note that your license differs from this License) and (b) otherwise
make it clear that Your version of the license contains terms which
differ from the SNIA Public License. (Filling in the name of the
Initial Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice
described in Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be
modifications of this License.)

7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. COVERED
CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN ""AS IS"" BASIS, WITHOUT
WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS,
MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE
ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS
WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU
(NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST
OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF
WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY
COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

8.
TERMINATION.

8.1 This License and the rights granted hereunder will
terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and
fail to cure such breach within a reasonable time after becoming aware
of the breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly
granted shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions
which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination
of this License shall survive.  

8.2 If You initiate litigation by
asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment
actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial
Developer or Contributor against whom You file such action is referred
to as ""Participant"") alleging that: o (a) such Participant's
Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then
any and all rights granted by such Participant to You under Sections
2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from
Participant terminate prospectively, unless if within 60 days after
receipt of notice You either: (i) agree in writing to pay Participant
a mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and future use
of Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your
litigation claim with respect to the Contributor Version against such
Participant. If within 60 days of notice, a reasonable royalty and
payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the
parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted
by Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically
terminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice period specified
above.  

8.3 If You assert a patent infringement claim against
Participant alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version
directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is
resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of
patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the
licenses granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall
be taken into account in determining the amount or value of any
payment or license.  

8.4 In the event of termination under Sections
8.1 or 8.2 above, all end user license agreements (excluding
distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or
any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive
termination.

9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND
UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT,
OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR,
OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH
PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL,
INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING,
WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE,
COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL
DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT
APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH
PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH
LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR
LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION
AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.
The Covered Code is a ""commercial item,"" as that term is defined in 48
C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of ""commercial computer software""
and ""commercial computer software documentation,"" as such terms are
used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R.
12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all
U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those rights
set forth herein.

11. MISCELLANEOUS This License represents the
complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof. If any provision
of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be
reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This
License shall be governed by California law provisions (except to the
extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding its
conflict-of-law provisions. The application of the United Nations
Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is
expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the
language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall
not apply to this License.

12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS. As between
Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible for
claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its
utilization of rights under this License and You agree to work with
Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such responsibility
on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed
to constitute any admission of liability.

13. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE.
Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as
""Multiple-Licensed"". ""Multiple-Licensed"" means that the Initial
Developer permits you to utilize portions of the Covered Code under
Your choice of this License or the alternative licenses, if any,
specified by the Initial Developer in the file described in Exhibit
A.

14. ACCEPTANCE. This License is accepted by You if You retain,
use, or distribute the Covered Code for any purpose.

for all users the freedom to share and change software.  If anyone
wonders about the meaning of the SimPL, they should interpret it as
consistent with GPL 2.0.

Simple Public License (SimPL) 2.0

The SimPL
applies to the software's source and object code and comes with any
rights that I have in it (other than trademarks). You agree to the
SimPL by copying, distributing, or making a derivative work of the
software.

You get the royalty free right to:
     
- Use the software
for any purpose;
- Make derivative works of it (this is called a
""Derived Work"");
- Copy and distribute it and any Derived Work.

If
you distribute the software or a Derived Work, you must give back to
the community by:

- Prominently noting the date of any changes you
make;
- Leaving other people's copyright notices, warranty
disclaimers, and license terms  in place;
- Providing the source code,
build scripts, installation scripts, and interface definitions in a
form that is easy to get and best to modify;
- Licensing it to
everyone under SimPL, or substantially similar terms (such as GPL
2.0), without adding further restrictions to the rights provided;
-
Conspicuously announcing that it is available under that
license.

There are some things that you must shoulder:

- You get NO
WARRANTIES. None of any kind;
- If the software damages you in any
way, you may only recover direct damages up to the amount you paid for
it (that is zero if you did not pay anything). You may not recover any
other damages, including those called ""consequential damages."" (The
state or country where you live may not allow you to limit your
liability in this way, so this may not apply to you);

The SimPL
continues perpetually, except that your license rights end
automatically if:

- You do not abide by the ""give back to the
community"" terms (your licensees get to keep their rights if they
abide);
- Anyone prevents you from distributing the software under the
terms of the SimPL.

License for the License

You may do anything that
you want with the SimPL text; it's a license form to use in any way
that you find helpful.  To avoid confusion, however, if you change the
terms in any way then you may not call your license the Simple Public
License or the SimPL (but feel free to acknowledge that your license
is ""based on the Simple Public License"").

I) There are no restrictions on distributing unmodified
copies of Vim except that they must include this license text. You can
also distribute unmodified parts of Vim, likewise unrestricted except
that they must include this license text. You are also allowed to
include executables that you made from the unmodified Vim sources,
plus your own usage examples and Vim scripts.

II) It is allowed to
distribute a modified (or extended) version of Vim, including
executables and/or source code, when the following four conditions are
met: 

     1) This license text must be included unmodified. 

    
2) The modified Vim must be distributed in one of the following five
ways:
 
          a) If you make changes to Vim yourself, you must
clearly describe in the distribution how to contact you. When the
maintainer asks you (in any way) for a copy of the modified Vim you
distributed, you must make your changes, including source code,
available to the maintainer without fee. The maintainer reserves the
right to include your changes in the official version of Vim. What the
maintainer will do with your changes and under what license they will
be distributed is negotiable. If there has been no negotiation then
this license, or a later version, also applies to your changes. The
current maintainer is Bram Moolenaar <Bram@vim.org>. If this changes
it will be announced in appropriate places (most likely vim.sf.net,
www.vim.org and/or comp.editors). When it is completely impossible to
contact the maintainer, the obligation to send him your changes
ceases. Once the maintainer has confirmed that he has received your
changes they will not have to be sent again. 

          b) If you
have received a modified Vim that was distributed as mentioned under
a) you are allowed to further distribute it unmodified, as mentioned
at I). If you make additional changes the text under a) applies to
those changes. 

          c) Provide all the changes, including
source code, with every copy of the modified Vim you distribute. This
may be done in the form of a context diff. You can choose what license
to use for new code you add. The changes and their license must not
restrict others from making their own changes to the official version
of Vim. 

          d) When you have a modified Vim which includes
changes as mentioned under c), you can distribute it without the
source code for the changes if the following three conditions are met:

          - The license that applies to the changes permits you to
distribute the changes to the Vim maintainer without fee or
restriction, and permits the Vim maintainer to include the changes in
the official version of Vim without fee or restriction. 
          -
You keep the changes for at least three years after last distributing
the corresponding modified Vim. When the maintainer or someone who you
distributed the modified Vim to asks you (in any way) for the changes
within this period, you must make them available to him. 
          -
You clearly describe in the distribution how to contact you. This
contact information must remain valid for at least three years after
last distributing the corresponding modified Vim, or as long as
possible. 

          e) When the GNU General Public License (GPL)
applies to the changes, you can distribute the modified Vim under the
GNU GPL version 2 or any later version. 

     3) A message must be
added, at least in the output of the "":version"" command and in the
intro screen, such that the user of the modified Vim is able to see
that it was modified. When distributing as mentioned under 2)e) adding
the message is only required for as far as this does not conflict with
the license used for the changes. 

     4) The contact information as
required under 2)a) and 2)d) must not be removed or changed, except
that the person himself can make corrections.

III) If you distribute
a modified version of Vim, you are encouraged to use the Vim license
for your changes and make them available to the maintainer, including
the source code. The preferred way to do this is by e-mail or by
uploading the files to a server and e-mailing the URL. If the number
of changes is small (e.g., a modified Makefile) e-mailing a context
diff will do. The e-mail address to be used is <maintainer@vim.org>


IV) It is not allowed to remove this license from the distribution
of the Vim sources, parts of it or from a modified version. You may
use this license for previous Vim releases instead of the license that
they came with, at your option.

This Yahoo! Public License
(this ""Agreement"") is a legal agreement that describes the terms under
which Yahoo! Inc., a Delaware corporation having its principal place
of business at 701 First Avenue, Sunnyvale, California 94089
(""Yahoo!"") will provide software to you via download or otherwise
(""Software""). By using the Software, you, an individual or an entity
(""You"") agree to the terms of this Agreement.

In consideration of the
mutual promises and upon the terms and conditions set forth below, the
parties agree as follows:

1. Grant of Copyright License
	
     1.1 -
Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Yahoo! hereby
grants to You, under any and all of its copyright interest in and to
the Software, a royalty-free, non-exclusive, non-transferable license
to copy, modify, compile, execute, and distribute the Software and
Modifications. For the purposes of this Agreement, any change to,
addition to, or abridgement of the Software made by You is a
""Modification;"" however, any file You add to the Software that does
not contain any part of the Software is not a ""Modification.""
	
    
1.2 - If You are an individual acting on behalf of a corporation or
other entity, Your use of the Software or any Modification is subject
to Your having the authority to bind such corporation or entity to
this Agreement. Providing copies to persons within such corporation or
entity is not considered distribution for purposes of this
Agreement.
	
     1.3 - For the Software or any Modification You
distribute in source code format, You must do so only under the terms
of this Agreement, and You must include a complete copy of this
Agreement with Your distribution. With respect to any Modification You
distribute in source code format, the terms of this Agreement will
apply to You in the same way those terms apply to Yahoo! with respect
to the Software. In other words, when You are distributing
Modifications under this Agreement, You ""stand in the shoes"" of Yahoo!
in terms of the rights You grant and how the terms and conditions
apply to You and the licensees of Your Modifications. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, when You ""stand in the shoes"" of Yahoo!, You are not
subject to the jurisdiction provision under Section 7, which requires
all disputes under this Agreement to be subject to the jurisdiction of
federal or state courts of northern California.
	
     1.4 - For the
Software or any Modification You distribute in compiled or object code
format, You must also provide recipients with access to the Software
or Modification in source code format along with a complete copy of
this Agreement. The distribution of the Software or Modifications in
compiled or object code format may be under a license of Your choice,
provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this Agreement.
In addition, You must make absolutely clear that any license terms
applying to such Software or Modification that differ from this
Agreement are offered by You alone and not by Yahoo!, and that such
license does not restrict recipients from exercising rights in the
source code to the Software granted by Yahoo! under this Agreement or
rights in the source code to any Modification granted by You as
described in Section 1.3.
	
     1.5 - This Agreement does not limit
Your right to distribute files that are entirely Your own work (i.e.,
which do not incorporate any portion of the Software and are not
Modifications) under any terms You choose.

2. Support
Yahoo! has no
obligation to provide technical support or updates to You. Nothing in
this Agreement requires Yahoo! to enter into any license with You for
any other edition of the Software.

3.  Intellectual Property
Rights
	
     3.1 - Except for the license expressly granted under
copyright in Section 1.1, no rights, licenses or forbearances are
granted or may arise in relation to this Agreement whether expressly,
by implication, exhaustion, estoppel or otherwise. All rights,
including all intellectual property rights, that are not expressly
granted under this Agreement are hereby reserved.
	
     3.2 - In any
copy of the Software or in any Modification you create, You must
retain and reproduce, any and all copyright, patent, trademark, and
attribution notices that are included in the Software in the same form
as they appear in the Software. This includes the preservation of
attribution notices in the form of trademarks or logos that exist
within a user interface of the Software.
	
     3.3 - This license
does not grant You rights to use any party's name, logo, or
trademarks, except solely as necessary to comply with Section 3.2.

4.
 Disclaimer of Warranties
THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED ""AS IS"" AND WITHOUT
WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. YAHOO! MAKES NO WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS,
IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY REGARDING OR RELATING TO THE SOFTWARE.
SPECIFICALLY, YAHOO! DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE SOFTWARE WILL BE ERROR
FREE OR WILL PERFORM IN AN UNINTERRUPTED MANNER. TO THE GREATEST
EXTENT ALLOWED BY LAW, YAHOO! SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS ALL IMPLIED
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE (EVEN
IF YAHOO! HAD BEEN INFORMED OF SUCH PURPOSE), AND NONINFRINGEMENT WITH
RESPECT TO THE SOFTWARE, ANY MODIFICATIONS THERETO AND WITH RESPECT TO
THE USE OF THE FOREGOING.

5.  Limitation of Liability
IN NO EVENT
WILL YAHOO! BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,
EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND (INCLUDING WITHOUT
LIMITATION LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF USE, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS
OF DATA, COST OF COVER) IN CONNECTION WITH OR ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THE FURNISHING, PERFORMANCE OR USE OF THE SOFTWARE OR ANY
OTHER RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, WHETHER ALLEGED AS A BREACH OF
CONTRACT OR TORTIOUS CONDUCT, INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE, AND EVEN IF YAHOO!
HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

6.  Term and
Termination
	
     6.1 - This Agreement will continue in effect unless
and until terminated earlier pursuant to this Section 6.
	
     6.2 -
In the event Yahoo! determines that You have breached this Agreement,
Yahoo! may terminate this Agreement.
	
     6.3 - All licenses granted
hereunder shall terminate upon the termination of this Agreement.
Termination will be in addition to any rights and remedies available
to Yahoo! at law or equity or under this Agreement.
	
     6.4 -
Termination of this Agreement will not affect the provisions regarding
reservation of rights (Section 3.1), provisions disclaiming or
limiting Yahoo!'s liability (Sections 4 and 5), Termination (Section
6) or Miscellaneous (Section 7), which provisions will survive
termination of this Agreement.

7.  Miscellaneous
This Agreement
contains the entire agreement of the parties with respect to the
subject matter of this Agreement and supersedes all previous
communications, representations, understandings and agreements, either
oral or written, between the parties with respect to said subject
matter. The relationship of the parties hereunder is that of
independent contractors, and this Agreement will not be construed as
creating an agency, partnership, joint venture or any other form of
legal association between the parties. If any term, condition, or
provision in this Agreement is found to be invalid, unlawful or
unenforceable to any extent, this Agreement will be construed in a
manner that most closely effectuates the intent of this Agreement.
Such invalid term, condition or provision will be severed from the
remaining terms, conditions and provisions, which will continue to be
valid and enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law. This
Agreement will be interpreted and construed in accordance with the
laws of the State of California and the United States of America,
without regard to conflict of law principles. The U.N. Convention on
Contracts for the International Sale of Goods shall not apply to this
Agreement. All disputes arising out of this Agreement involving Yahoo!
or any of its subsidiaries shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the
federal or state courts of northern California, with venue lying in
Santa Clara County, California. No rights may be assigned, no
obligations may be delegated, and this Agreement may not be
transferred by You, in whole or in part, whether voluntary or by
operation of law, including by way of sale of assets, merger or
consolidation, without the prior written consent of Yahoo!, and any
purported assignment, delegation or transfer without such consent
shall be void ab initio. Any waiver of the provisions of this
Agreement or of a party's rights or remedies under this Agreement must
be in writing to be effective. Failure, neglect or delay by a party to
enforce the provisions of this Agreement or its rights or remedies at
any time, will not be construed or be deemed to be a waiver of such
party's rights under this Agreement and will not in any way affect the
validity of the whole or any part of this Agreement or prejudice such
party's right to take subsequent action.

This Zimbra Public License
(this ""Agreement"") is a legal agreement that describes the terms under
which VMware, Inc., a Delaware corporation having its principal place
of business at 3401 Hillview Avenue, Palo Alto, California 94304
(""VMware"") will provide software to you via download or otherwise
(""Software""). By using the Software, you, an individual or an entity
(""You"") agree to the terms of this Agreement.

In consideration of the
mutual promises and upon the terms and conditions set forth below, the
parties agree as follows:

1. Grant of Copyright License

     1.1 -
Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, VMware hereby
grants to You, under any and all of its copyright interest in and to
the Software, a royalty-free, non-exclusive, non-transferable license
to copy, modify, compile, execute, and distribute the Software and
Modifications. For the purposes of this Agreement, any change to,
addition to, or abridgement of the Software made by You is a
""Modification;"" however, any file You add to the Software that does
not contain any part of the Software is not a ""Modification.""

    
1.2 - If You are an individual acting on behalf of a corporation or
other entity, Your use of the Software or any Modification is subject
to Your having the authority to bind such corporation or entity to
this Agreement. Providing copies to persons within such corporation or
entity is not considered distribution for purposes of this
Agreement.

     1.3 - For the Software or any Modification You
distribute in source code format, You must do so only under the terms
of this Agreement, and You must include a complete copy of this
Agreement with Your distribution. With respect to any Modification You
distribute in source code format, the terms of this Agreement will
apply to You in the same way those terms apply to VMware with respect
to the Software. In other words, when You are distributing
Modifications under this Agreement, You ""stand in the shoes"" of VMware
in terms of the rights You grant and how the terms and conditions
apply to You and the licensees of Your Modifications. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, when You ""stand in the shoes"" of VMware, You are not
subject to the jurisdiction provision under Section 7, which requires
all disputes under this Agreement to be subject to the jurisdiction of
federal or state courts of northern California.

     1.4 - For the
Software or any Modification You distribute in compiled or object code
format, You must also provide recipients with access to the Software
or Modification in source code format along with a complete copy of
this Agreement. The distribution of the Software or Modifications in
compiled or object code format may be under a license of Your choice,
provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this Agreement.
In addition, You must make absolutely clear that any license terms
applying to such Software or Modification that differ from this
Agreement are offered by You alone and not by VMware, and that such
license does not restrict recipients from exercising rights in the
source code to the Software granted by VMware under this Agreement or
rights in the source code to any Modification granted by You as
described in Section 1.3.

     1.5 - This Agreement does not limit
Your right to distribute files that are entirely Your own work (i.e.,
which do not incorporate any portion of the Software and are not
Modifications) under any terms You choose.

2. Support
VMware has no
obligation to provide technical support or updates to You. Nothing in
this Agreement requires VMware to enter into any license with You for
any other edition of the Software.

3. Intellectual Property Rights

 
   3.1 - Except for the license expressly granted under copyright in
Section 1.1, no rights, licenses or forbearances are granted or may
arise in relation to this Agreement whether expressly, by implication,
exhaustion, estoppel or otherwise. All rights, including all
intellectual property rights, that are not expressly granted under
this Agreement are hereby reserved.

     3.2 - In any copy of the
Software or in any Modification you create, You must retain and
reproduce, any and all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution
notices that are included in the Software in the same form as they
appear in the Software. This includes the preservation of attribution
notices in the form of trademarks or logos that exist within a user
interface of the Software.

     3.3 - This license does not grant You
rights to use any party's name, logo, or trademarks, except solely as
necessary to comply with Section 3.2.

4. Disclaimer of Warranties
THE
SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED ""AS IS"" AND WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. VMWARE
MAKES NO WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY REGARDING
OR RELATING TO THE SOFTWARE. SPECIFICALLY, VMWARE DOES NOT WARRANT
THAT THE SOFTWARE WILL BE ERROR FREE OR WILL PERFORM IN AN
UNINTERRUPTED MANNER. TO THE GREATEST EXTENT ALLOWED BY LAW, VMWARE
SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE (EVEN IF VMWARE HAD BEEN INFORMED OF
SUCH PURPOSE), AND NONINFRINGEMENT WITH RESPECT TO THE SOFTWARE, ANY
MODIFICATIONS THERETO AND WITH RESPECT TO THE USE OF THE
FOREGOING.

5. Limitation of Liability
IN NO EVENT WILL VMWARE BE
LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOSS
OF PROFITS, LOSS OF USE, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF DATA, COST OF
COVER) IN CONNECTION WITH OR ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE
FURNISHING, PERFORMANCE OR USE OF THE SOFTWARE OR ANY OTHER RIGHTS
GRANTED HEREUNDER, WHETHER ALLEGED AS A BREACH OF CONTRACT OR TORTIOUS
CONDUCT, INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE, AND EVEN IF VMWARE HAS BEEN ADVISED OF
THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

6. Term and Termination

     6.1 -
This Agreement will continue in effect unless and until terminated
earlier pursuant to this Section 6.

     6.2 - In the event You
violate the terms of this Agreement, VMware may terminate this
Agreement.

     6.3 - All licenses granted hereunder shall terminate
upon the termination of this Agreement. Termination will be in
addition to any rights and remedies available to VMware at law or
equity or under this Agreement.

     6.4 - Termination of this
Agreement will not affect the provisions regarding reservation of
rights (Section 3.1), provisions disclaiming or limiting VMware's
liability (Sections 4 and 5), Termination (Section 6) or Miscellaneous
(Section 7), which provisions will survive termination of this
Agreement.

7. Miscellaneous
This Agreement contains the entire
agreement of the parties with respect to the subject matter of this
Agreement and supersedes all previous communications, representations,
understandings and agreements, either oral or written, between the
parties with respect to said subject matter. The relationship of the
parties hereunder is that of independent contractors, and this
Agreement will not be construed as creating an agency, partnership,
joint venture or any other form of legal association between the
parties. If any term, condition, or provision in this Agreement is
found to be invalid, unlawful or unenforceable to any extent, this
Agreement will be construed in a manner that most closely effectuates
the intent of this Agreement. Such invalid term, condition or
provision will be severed from the remaining terms, conditions and
provisions, which will continue to be valid and enforceable to the
fullest extent permitted by law. This Agreement will be interpreted
and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California
and the United States of America, without regard to conflict of law
principles. The U.N. Convention on Contracts for the International
Sale of Goods shall not apply to this Agreement. All disputes arising
out of this Agreement involving VMware or any of its subsidiaries
shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the federal or state courts of
northern California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County,
California. No rights may be assigned, no obligations may be
delegated, and this Agreement may not be transferred by You, in whole
or in part, whether voluntary or by operation of law, including by way
of sale of assets, merger or consolidation, without the prior written
consent of VMware, and any purported assignment, delegation or
transfer without such consent shall be void ab initio. Any waiver of
the provisions of this Agreement or of a party's rights or remedies
under this Agreement must be in writing to be effective. Failure,
neglect or delay by a party to enforce the provisions of this
Agreement or its rights or remedies at any time, will not be construed
or be deemed to be a waiver of such party's rights under this
Agreement and will not in any way affect the validity of the whole or
any part of this Agreement or prejudice such party's right to take
subsequent action.

This Zimbra Public License
(this “Agreement”) is a legal agreement that describes the terms
under which Zimbra, Inc., a Texas corporation (“Zimbra”) will
provide software to you via download or otherwise (“Software”). By
using the Software, you, an individual or an entity (“You”) agree
to the terms of this Agreement.

In consideration of the mutual
promises and upon the terms and conditions set forth below, the
parties agree as follows:

1. Grant of Copyright License

     1.1 -
Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Zimbra hereby
grants to You, under any and all of its copyright interest in and to
the Software, a royalty-free, non-exclusive, non-transferable license
to copy, modify, compile, execute, and distribute the Software and
Modifications. For the purposes of this Agreement, any change to,
addition to, or abridgement of the Software made by You is a
“Modification;” however, any file You add to the Software that
does not contain any part of the Software is not a
“Modification.”
		
     1.2 - If You are an individual acting on
behalf of a corporation or other entity, Your use of the Software or
any Modification is subject to Your having the authority to bind such
corporation or entity to this Agreement. Providing copies to persons
within such corporation or entity is not considered distribution for
purposes of this Agreement.
		
     1.3 - For the Software or any
Modification You distribute in source code format, You must do so only
under the terms of this Agreement, and You must include a complete
copy of this Agreement with Your distribution. With respect to any
Modification You distribute in source code format, the terms of this
Agreement will apply to You in the same way those terms apply to
Zimbra with respect to the Software. In other words, when You are
distributing Modifications under this Agreement, You “stand in the
shoes” of Zimbra in terms of the rights You grant and how the terms
and conditions apply to You and the licensees of Your Modifications.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, when You “stand in the shoes” of
Zimbra, You are not subject to the jurisdiction provision under
Section 7, which requires all disputes under this Agreement to be
subject to the jurisdiction of federal or state courts of Northern
Texas.
		
     1.4 - For the Software or any Modification You
distribute in compiled or object code format, You must also provide
recipients with access to the Software or Modification in source code
format along with a complete copy of this Agreement. The distribution
of the Software or Modifications in compiled or object code format may
be under a license of Your choice, provided that You are in compliance
with the terms of this Agreement. In addition, You must make
absolutely clear that any license terms applying to such Software or
Modification that differ from this Agreement are offered by You alone
and not by Zimbra, and that such license does not restrict recipients
from exercising rights in the source code to the Software granted by
Zimbra under this Agreement or rights in the source code to any
Modification granted by You as described in Section 1.3.
		
     1.5 -
This Agreement does not limit Your right to distribute files that are
entirely Your own work (i.e., which do not incorporate any portion of
the Software and are not Modifications) under any terms You
choose.
		
2. Support
Zimbra has no obligation to provide technical
support or updates to You. Nothing in this Agreement requires Zimbra
to enter into any license with You for any other edition of the
Software.
		
3. Intellectual Property Rights
		
     3.1 - Except for
the license expressly granted under copyright in Section 1.1, no
rights, licenses or forbearances are granted or may arise in relation
to this Agreement whether expressly, by implication, exhaustion,
estoppel or otherwise. All rights, including all intellectual property
rights, that are not expressly granted under this Agreement are hereby
reserved.
		
     3.2 - In any copy of the Software or in any
Modification you create, You must retain and reproduce any and all
copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices that are
included in the Software in the same form as they appear in the
Software. This includes the preservation of attribution notices in the
form of trademarks or logos that exist within a user interface of the
Software.
		
     3.3 - This license does not grant You rights to use
any party’s name, logo, or trademarks, except solely as necessary to
comply with Section 3.2.

ANY KIND (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF USE,

This is an exerpt from an
email I recieved from the original author, allowing xinetd as
maintained by me (Rob Braun), to use the higher version numbers:

I
appreciate your maintaining the version string guidelines as specified
in the copyright. But I did not mean them to last as long as they
did.

So, if you want, you may use any 2.N.* (N >= 3) version string
for future xinetd versions that you release. Note that I am excluding
the 2.2.* line; using that would only create confusion. Naming the
next release 2.3.0 would put to rest the confusion about 2.2.1 and
2.1.8.*.

Version 1, March 2002 
 
Copyright ©
2002 Affero Inc. 
510 Third Street - Suite 225, San Francisco, CA
94107, USA

This license is a modified version of the GNU General
Public License copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
made with their permission. Section 2(d) has been added to cover use
of software over a computer network.

Everyone is permitted to copy
and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing
it is not allowed.

Preamble

The licenses for most software are
designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By
contrast, the Affero General Public License is intended to guarantee
your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the
software is free for all its users. This Public License applies to
most of Affero's software and to any other program whose authors
commit to using it. (Some other Affero software is covered by the GNU
Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it to your
programs, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to
freedom, not price. This General Public License is designed to make
sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software
(and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source
code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or
use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do
these things.

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions
that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender
the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities
for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify
it.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the
software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.

Also, for
each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that
everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software.
If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its
recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that
any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

Finally, any free program is threatened
constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that
redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent
licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent this,
we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's
free use or not licensed at all.

The precise terms and conditions for
copying, distribution and modification follow.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS
FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

0. This License applies to
any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the
copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this
Affero General Public License. The ""Program"", below, refers to any
such program or work, and a ""work based on the Program"" means either
the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to
say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim
or with modifications and/or translated into another language.
(Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term
""modification"".) Each licensee is addressed as ""you"".

Activities
other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by
this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the
Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered
only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program
(independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that
is true depends on what the Program does.

1. You may copy and
distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive
it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately
publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of
warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and
to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the
Program a copy of this License along with the Program.

You may charge
a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your
option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

2. You may
modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus
forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such
modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided
that you also meet all of these conditions:

     a) You must cause
the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed
the files and the date of any change. 

     b) You must cause any
work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains
or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as
a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this
License. 

     c) If the modified program normally reads commands
interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running for
such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice
that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a
warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these
conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.
(Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally
print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not
required to print an announcement.) 

     d) If the Program as you
received it is intended to interact with users through a computer
network and if, in the version you received, any user interacting with
the Program was given the opportunity to request transmission to that
user of the Program's complete source code, you must not remove that
facility from your modified version of the Program or work based on
the Program, and must offer an equivalent opportunity for all users
interacting with your Program through a computer network to request
immediate transmission by HTTP of the complete source code of your
modified version or other derivative work.

These requirements apply
to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work
are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably considered
independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and
its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as
separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a
whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the
whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for
other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every
part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this
section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written
entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to
control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on
the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based
on the Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program)
on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the
other work under the scope of this License.

3. You may copy and
distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section 2) in
object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2
above provided that you also do one of the following: 

     a)
Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source
code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2
above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or, 

  
  b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of
physically performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable
copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the
terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for
software interchange; or, 

     c) Accompany it with the information
you received as to the offer to distribute corresponding source code.
(This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and
only if you received the program in object code or executable form
with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

The source
code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code
means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or
object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated
place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from
the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though
third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the
object code.

4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute
the Program except as expressly provided under this License. Any
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the
Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights,
from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so
long as such parties remain in full compliance.

5. You are not
required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.
However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute
the Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by
law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or
distributing the Program (or any work based on the Program), you
indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms
and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program or
works based on it.

6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any
work based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a
license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the
Program subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any
further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted
herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third
parties to this License.

7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment
or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not
limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by
court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of
this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this
License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your
obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations,
then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all. For
example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free
redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly
or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it
and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the
Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or
unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the
section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to
apply in other circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section
to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims
or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole
purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution
system, which is implemented by public license practices. Many people
have made generous contributions to the wide range of software
distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application
of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is
willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee
cannot impose that choice.

This section is intended to make
thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of
this License.

8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is
restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted
interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program under
this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation
excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in
or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License
incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this
License.

9. Affero Inc. may publish revised and/or new versions of
the Affero General Public License from time to time. Such new versions
will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in
detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a
distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies a version
number of this License which applies to it and ""any later version"",
you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
that version or of any later version published by Affero, Inc. If the
Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may
choose any version ever published by Affero, Inc.

You may also choose
to redistribute modified versions of this program under any version of
the Free Software Foundation's GNU General Public License version 3 or
higher, so long as that version of the GNU GPL includes terms and
conditions substantially equivalent to those of this license.

10. If
you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs
whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to
ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by Affero, Inc.,
write to us; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will
be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all
derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and
reuse of software generally.

NO WARRANTY

11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS
LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE
EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN
WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM
""AS IS"" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK
AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD
THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY
SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY
APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR
ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS
PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL,
SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR
INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR
THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

Copyright
(C) 1994, 1995, 1997, 1998, 1999 Aladdin Enterprises, 
Menlo Park,
California, U.S.A. All rights reserved.

NOTE: This License is not the
same as any of the GNU Licenses published by the Free Software
Foundation. Its terms are substantially different from those of the
GNU Licenses. If you are familiar with the GNU Licenses, please read
this license with extra care.

Aladdin Enterprises hereby grants to
anyone the permission to apply this License to their own work, as long
as the entire License (including the above notices and this paragraph)
is copied with no changes, additions, or deletions except for changing
the first paragraph of Section 0 to include a suitable description of
the work to which the license is being applied and of the person or
entity that holds the copyright in the work, and, if the License is
being applied to a work created in a country other than the United
States, replacing the first paragraph of Section 6 with an appropriate
reference to the laws of the appropriate country.

0. Subject
Matter
This License applies to the computer program known as ""Aladdin
Ghostscript."" The ""Program"", below, refers to such program. The
Program is a copyrighted work whose copyright is held by Aladdin
Enterprises (the ""Licensor""). Please note that Aladdin Ghostscript is
neither the program known as ""GNU Ghostscript"" nor the version of
Ghostscript available for commercial licensing from Artifex Software
Inc.

A ""work based on the Program"" means either the Program or any
derivative work of the Program, as defined in the United States
Copyright Act of 1976, such as a translation or a modification.

BY
MODIFYING OR DISTRIBUTING THE PROGRAM (OR ANY WORK BASED ON THE
PROGRAM), YOU INDICATE YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THIS LICENSE TO DO SO, AND
ALL ITS TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTING OR MODIFYING
THE PROGRAM OR WORKS BASED ON IT. NOTHING OTHER THAN THIS LICENSE
GRANTS YOU PERMISSION TO MODIFY OR DISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM OR ITS
DERIVATIVE WORKS. THESE ACTIONS ARE PROHIBITED BY LAW. IF YOU DO NOT
ACCEPT THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, DO NOT MODIFY OR DISTRIBUTE THE
PROGRAM.

1. Licenses.
Licensor hereby grants you the following
rights, provided that you comply with all of the restrictions set
forth in this License and provided, further, that you distribute an
unmodified copy of this License with the Program:

     (a) You may
copy and distribute literal (i.e., verbatim) copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it throughout the world, in any medium.
   
 (b) You may modify the Program, create works based on the Program and
distribute copies of such throughout the world, in any medium.

2.
Restrictions.
This license is subject to the following restrictions:


    (a) Distribution of the Program or any work based on the Program
by a commercial organization to any third party is prohibited if any
payment is made in connection with such distribution, whether directly
(as in payment for a copy of the Program) or indirectly (as in payment
for some service related to the Program, or payment for some product
or service that includes a copy of the Program ""without charge""; these
are only examples, and not an exhaustive enumeration of prohibited
activities). The following methods of distribution involving payment
shall not in and of themselves be a violation of this restriction:

  
       (i) Posting the Program on a public access information storage
and retrieval service for which a fee is received for retrieving
information (such as an on-line service), provided that the fee is not
content-dependent (i.e., the fee would be the same for retrieving the
same volume of information consisting of random data) and that access
to the service and to the Program is available independent of any
other product or service. An example of a service that does not fall
under this section is an on-line service that is operated by a company
and that is only available to customers of that company. (This is not
an exhaustive enumeration.)
          (ii) Distributing the Program on
removable computer-readable media, provided that the files containing
the Program are reproduced entirely and verbatim on such media, that
all information on such media be redistributable for non-commercial
purposes without charge, and that such media are distributed by
themselves (except for accompanying documentation) independent of any
other product or service. Examples of such media include CD-ROM,
magnetic tape, and optical storage media. (This is not intended to be
an exhaustive list.) An example of a distribution that does not fall
under this section is a CD-ROM included in a book or magazine. (This
is not an exhaustive enumeration.)

     (b) Activities other than
copying, distribution and modification of the Program are not subject
to this License and they are outside its scope. Functional use
(running) of the Program is not restricted, and any output produced
through the use of the Program is subject to this license only if its
contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having
been made by running the Program).

     (c) You must meet all of the
following conditions with respect to any work that you distribute or
publish that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the
Program or any part thereof (""the Work""):

          (i) If you have
modified the Program, you must cause the Work to carry prominent
notices stating that you have modified the Program's files and the
date of any change. In each source file that you have modified, you
must include a prominent notice that you have modified the file,
including your name, your e-mail address (if any), and the date and
purpose of the change;
          (ii) You must cause the Work to be
licensed as a whole and at no charge to all third parties under the
terms of this License;
          (iii) If the Work normally reads
commands interactively when run, you must cause it, at each time the
Work commences operation, to print or display an announcement
including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is
no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty). Such notice
must also state that users may redistribute the Work only under the
conditions of this License and tell the user how to view the copy of
this License included with the Work. (Exceptions: if the Program is
interactive but normally prints or displays such an announcement only
at the request of a user, such as in an ""About box"", the Work is
required to print or display the notice only under the same
circumstances; if the Program itself is interactive but does not
normally print such an announcement, the Work is not required to print
an announcement.);
          (iv) You must accompany the Work with the
complete corresponding machine-readable source code, delivered on a
medium customarily used for software interchange. The source code for
a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications
to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all the
source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface
definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and
installation of the executable code. If you distribute with the Work
any component that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, you must also
distribute the source code of that component if you have it and are
allowed to do so;
          (v) If you distribute any written or
printed material at all with the Work, such material must include
either a written copy of this License, or a prominent written
indication that the Work is covered by this License and written
instructions for printing and/or displaying the copy of the License on
the distribution medium;
          (vi) You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipient's exercise of the rights granted
herein.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by
offering the equivalent ability to copy from a designated place, then
offering equivalent ability to copy the source code from the same
place counts as distribution of the source code, even though third
parties are not compelled to copy the source code along with the
object code.

3. Reservation of Rights.
No rights are granted to the
Program except as expressly set forth herein. You may not copy,
modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly
provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify,
sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically
terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have
received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have
their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full
compliance.

4. Other Restrictions.
If the distribution and/or use of
the Program is restricted in certain countries for any reason,
Licensor may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation
excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in
or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License
incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this
License.

5. Limitations.
THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED TO YOU ""AS IS,""
WITHOUT WARRANTY. THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, EITHER
EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND
NONINFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE
QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM
PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW
OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL LICENSOR, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY
MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE
TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES.

6. General.
This License is governed by the laws of the
State of California, U.S.A., excluding choice of law rules.

If any
part of this License is found to be in conflict with the law, that
part shall be interpreted in its broadest meaning consistent with the
law, and no other parts of the License shall be affected.

For United
States Government users, the Program is provided with RESTRICTED
RIGHTS. If you are a unit or agency of the United States Government or
are acquiring the Program for any such unit or agency, the following
apply:

If the unit or agency is the Department of Defense (""DOD""),
the Program and its documentation are classified as ""commercial
computer software"" and ""commercial computer software documentation""
respectively and, pursuant to DFAR Section 227.7202, the Government is
acquiring the Program and its documentation in accordance with the
terms of this License. If the unit or agency is other than DOD, the
Program and its documentation are classified as ""commercial computer
software"" and ""commercial computer software documentation""
respectively and, pursuant to FAR Section 12.212, the Government is
acquiring the Program and its documentation in accordance with the
terms of this License.

Preamble

The intent of this document is to
state the conditions under which a Package may be copied, such that
the Copyright Holder maintains some semblance of artistic control over
the development of the package, while giving the users of the package
the right to use and distribute the Package in a more-or-less
customary fashion, plus the right to make reasonable
modifications.

Definitions:

     ""Package"" refers to the collection
of files distributed by the Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that
collection of files created through textual modification.

    
""Standard Version"" refers to such a Package if it has not been
modified, or has been modified in accordance with the wishes of the
Copyright Holder as specified below.

     ""Copyright Holder"" is
whoever is named in the copyright or copyrights for the package.

    
""You"" is you, if you're thinking about copying or distributing this
Package.

     ""Reasonable copying fee"" is whatever you can justify on
the basis of media cost, duplication charges, time of people involved,
and so on.  (You will not be required to justify it to the Copyright
Holder, but only to the computing community at large as a market that
must bear the fee.)

     ""Freely Available"" means that no fee is
charged for the item itself, though there may be fees involved in
handling the item. It also means that recipients of the item may
redistribute it under the same conditions they received it.

1. You
may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the
Standard Version of this Package without restriction, provided that
you duplicate all of the original copyright notices and associated
disclaimers.

2. You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other
modifications derived from the Public Domain or from the Copyright
Holder.  A Package modified in such a way shall still be considered
the Standard Version.

3. You may otherwise modify your copy of this
Package in any way, provided that you insert a prominent notice in
each changed file stating how and when you changed that file, and
provided that you do at least ONE of the following:

     a) place
your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make them Freely
Available, such as by posting said modifications to Usenet or an
equivalent medium, or placing the modifications on a major archive
site such as uunet.uu.net, or by allowing the Copyright Holder to
include your modifications in the Standard Version of the Package.
   
 b) use the modified Package only within your corporation or
organization.
     c) rename any non-standard executables so the names
do not conflict with standard executables, which must also be
provided, and provide a separate manual page for each non-standard
executable that clearly documents how it differs from the Standard
Version.
     d) make other distribution arrangements with the
Copyright Holder.

4. You may distribute the programs of this Package
in object code or executable form, provided that you do at least ONE
of the following:

     a) distribute a Standard Version of the
executables and library files, together with instructions (in the
manual page or equivalent) on where to get the Standard Version.
    
b) accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of the
Package with your modifications.
     c) give non-standard executables
non-standard names, and clearly document the differences in manual
pages (or equivalent), together with instructions on where to get the
Standard Version.
     d) make other distribution arrangements with
the Copyright Holder.

5. You may charge a reasonable copying fee for
any distribution of this Package.  You may charge any fee you choose
for support of this Package.  You may not charge a fee for this
Package itself.  However, you may distribute this Package in aggregate
with other (possibly commercial) programs as part of a larger
(possibly commercial) software distribution provided that you do not
advertise this Package as a product of your own.  You may embed this
Package's interpreter within an executable of yours (by linking); this
shall be construed as a mere form of aggregation, provided that the
complete Standard Version of the interpreter is so embedded.

6. The
scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as output
from the programs of this Package do not automatically fall under the
copyright of this Package, but belong to whoever generated them, and
may be sold commercially, and may be aggregated with this Package.  If
such scripts or library files are aggregated with this Package via the
so-called ""undump"" or ""unexec"" methods of producing a binary
executable image, then distribution of such an image shall neither be
construed as a distribution of this Package nor shall it fall under
the restrictions of Paragraphs 3 and 4, provided that you do not
represent such an executable image as a Standard Version of this
Package.

7. C subroutines (or comparably compiled subroutines in
other languages) supplied by you and linked into this Package in order
to emulate subroutines and variables of the language defined by this
Package shall not be considered part of this Package, but are the
equivalent of input as in Paragraph 6, provided these subroutines do
not change the language in any way that would cause it to fail the
regression tests for the language.

8. Aggregation of this Package
with a commercial distribution is always permitted provided that the
use of this Package is embedded; that is, when no overt attempt is
made to make this Package's interfaces visible to the end user of the
commercial distribution.  Such use shall not be construed as a
distribution of this Package.

9. The name of the Copyright Holder may
not be used to endorse or promote products derived from this software
without specific prior written permission.

10. THIS PACKAGE IS

Copyright (c) 2000-2006, The Perl
Foundation.

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim
copies of this license document, but changing it is not
allowed.

Preamble

This license establishes the terms under which a
given free software Package may be copied, modified, distributed,
and/or redistributed. The intent is that the Copyright Holder
maintains some artistic control over the development of that Package
while still keeping the Package available as open source and free
software.

You are always permitted to make arrangements wholly
outside of this license directly with the Copyright Holder of a given
Package.  If the terms of this license do not permit the full use that
you propose to make of the Package, you should contact the Copyright
Holder and seek a different licensing arrangement. 

Definitions

    
""Copyright Holder"" means the individual(s) or organization(s) named in
the copyright notice for the entire Package.

     ""Contributor"" means
any party that has contributed code or other material to the Package,
in accordance with the Copyright Holder's procedures.

     ""You"" and
""your"" means any person who would like to copy, distribute, or modify
the Package.

     ""Package"" means the collection of files distributed
by the Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection and/or of
those files. A given Package may consist of either the Standard
Version, or a Modified Version.

     ""Distribute"" means providing a
copy of the Package or making it accessible to anyone else, or in the
case of a company or organization, to others outside of your company
or organization.

     ""Distributor Fee"" means any fee that you charge
for Distributing this Package or providing support for this Package to
another party.  It does not mean licensing fees.

     ""Standard
Version"" refers to the Package if it has not been modified, or has
been modified only in ways explicitly requested by the Copyright
Holder.

     ""Modified Version"" means the Package, if it has been
changed, and such changes were not explicitly requested by the
Copyright Holder. 

     ""Original License"" means this Artistic
License as Distributed with the Standard Version of the Package, in
its current version or as it may be modified by The Perl Foundation in
the future.

     ""Source"" form means the source code, documentation
source, and configuration files for the Package.

     ""Compiled"" form
means the compiled bytecode, object code, binary, or any other form
resulting from mechanical transformation or translation of the Source
form.

Permission for Use and Modification Without Distribution

(1)
You are permitted to use the Standard Version and create and use
Modified Versions for any purpose without restriction, provided that
you do not Distribute the Modified Version.

Permissions for
Redistribution of the Standard Version

(2) You may Distribute
verbatim copies of the Source form of the Standard Version of this
Package in any medium without restriction, either gratis or for a
Distributor Fee, provided that you duplicate all of the original
copyright notices and associated disclaimers.  At your discretion,
such verbatim copies may or may not include a Compiled form of the
Package.

(3) You may apply any bug fixes, portability changes, and
other modifications made available from the Copyright Holder.  The
resulting Package will still be considered the Standard Version, and
as such will be subject to the Original License.

Distribution of
Modified Versions of the Package as Source 

(4) You may Distribute
your Modified Version as Source (either gratis or for a Distributor
Fee, and with or without a Compiled form of the Modified Version)
provided that you clearly document how it differs from the Standard
Version, including, but not limited to, documenting any non-standard
features, executables, or modules, and provided that you do at least
ONE of the following:

     (a) make the Modified Version available to
the Copyright Holder of the Standard Version, under the Original
License, so that the Copyright Holder may include your modifications
in the Standard Version.
     (b) ensure that installation of your
Modified Version does not prevent the user installing or running the
Standard Version. In addition, the Modified Version must bear a name
that is different from the name of the Standard Version.
     (c)
allow anyone who receives a copy of the Modified Version to make the
Source form of the Modified Version available to others under

       
  (i) the Original License or
          (ii) a license that permits
the licensee to freely copy, modify and redistribute the Modified
Version using the same licensing terms that apply to the copy that the
licensee received, and requires that the Source form of the Modified
Version, and of any works derived from it, be made freely available in
that license fees are prohibited but Distributor Fees are
allowed.

Distribution of Compiled Forms of the Standard Version or
Modified Versions without the Source

(5)  You may Distribute Compiled
forms of the Standard Version without the Source, provided that you
include complete instructions on how to get the Source of the Standard
Version.  Such instructions must be valid at the time of your
distribution.  If these instructions, at any time while you are
carrying out such distribution, become invalid, you must provide new
instructions on demand or cease further distribution. If you provide
valid instructions or cease distribution within thirty days after you
become aware that the instructions are invalid, then you do not
forfeit any of your rights under this license.

(6)  You may
Distribute a Modified Version in Compiled form without the Source,
provided that you comply with Section 4 with respect to the Source of
the Modified Version.

Aggregating or Linking the Package 

(7)  You
may aggregate the Package (either the Standard Version or Modified
Version) with other packages and Distribute the resulting aggregation
provided that you do not charge a licensing fee for the Package. 
Distributor Fees are permitted, and licensing fees for other
components in the aggregation are permitted. The terms of this license
apply to the use and Distribution of the Standard or Modified Versions
as included in the aggregation.

(8) You are permitted to link
Modified and Standard Versions with other works, to embed the Package
in a larger work of your own, or to build stand-alone binary or
bytecode versions of applications that include the Package, and
Distribute the result without restriction, provided the result does
not expose a direct interface to the Package.

Items That are Not
Considered Part of a Modified Version 

(9) Works (including, but not
limited to, modules and scripts) that merely extend or make use of the
Package, do not, by themselves, cause the Package to be a Modified
Version.  In addition, such works are not considered parts of the
Package itself, and are not subject to the terms of this
license.

General Provisions

(10)  Any use, modification, and
distribution of the Standard or Modified Versions is governed by this
Artistic License. By using, modifying or distributing the Package, you
accept this license. Do not use, modify, or distribute the Package, if
you do not accept this license.

(11)  If your Modified Version has
been derived from a Modified Version made by someone other than you,
you are nevertheless required to ensure that your Modified Version
complies with the requirements of this license.

(12)  This license
does not grant you the right to use any trademark, service mark,
tradename, or logo of the Copyright Holder.

(13)  This license
includes the non-exclusive, worldwide, free-of-charge patent license
to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import and otherwise
transfer the Package with respect to any patent claims licensable by
the Copyright Holder that are necessarily infringed by the Package. If
you institute patent litigation (including a cross-claim or
counterclaim) against any party alleging that the Package constitutes
direct or contributory patent infringement, then this Artistic License
to you shall terminate on the date that such litigation is
filed.

(14)  Disclaimer of Warranty:

February 2002

Preamble 
--------

The
Berkeley Software Distribution (""BSD"") license has proven very
effective over the years at allowing for a wide spread of work
throughout both commercial and non-commercial products. For
programmers whose primary intention is to improve the general quality
of available software, it is arguable that there is no better license
than the BSD license, as it permits improvements to be used wherever
they will help, without idealogical or metallic constraint.

This is
of particular value to those who produce reference implementations of
proposed standards: The case of TCP/IP clearly illustrates that freely
and universally available implementations leads the rapid acceptance
of standards -- often even being used instead of a de jure standard
(eg, OSI network models).

With the rapid proliferation of software
licensed under the GNU General Public License, however, the continued
success of this role is called into question. Given that the inclusion
of a few lines of ""GPL-tainted"" work into a larger body of work will
result in restricted distribution -- and given that further work will
likely build upon the ""tainted"" portions, making them difficult to
remove at a future date -- there are inevitable circumstances where
authors would, in order to protect their goal of providing for the
widespread usage of their work, wish to guard against such
""GPL-taint"".

In addition, one can imagine that companies which
operate by producing and selling (possibly closed-source) code would
wish to protect themselves against the rise of a GPL-licensed
competitor. While under existing licenses this would mean not
releasing their code under any form of open license, if a license
existed under which they could incorporate any improvements back into
their own (commercial) products then they might be far more willing to
provide for non-closed distribution.

For the above reasons, we put
forth this ""BSD Protection License"": A license designed to retain the
freedom granted by the BSD license to use licensed works in a wide
variety of settings, both non-commercial and commercial, while
protecting the work from having future contributors restrict that
freedom.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution,
and modification follow.

BSD PROTECTION LICENSE TERMS AND CONDITIONS
FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION, AND MODIFICATION

----------------------------------------------------------------

0.
Definitions. 

     a) ""Program"", below, refers to any program or work
distributed under the terms of this license. 
     b) A ""work based on
the Program"", below, refers to either the Program or any derivative
work under copyright law. 
     c) ""Modification"", below, refers to
the act of creating derivative works. 
     d) ""You"", below, refers to
each licensee.

1. Scope. 
This license governs the copying,
distribution, and modification of the Program. Other activities are
outside the scope of this license; The act of running the Program is
not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its
contents constitute a work based on the Program.

2. Verbatim copies.

You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program as you
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the
absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program
a copy of this License along with the Program.

3. Modification and
redistribution under closed license. 
You may modify your copy or
copies of the Program, and distribute the resulting derivative works,
provided that you meet the following conditions: 

     a) The
copyright notice and disclaimer on the Program must be reproduced and
included in the source code, documentation, and/or other materials
provided in a manner in which such notices are normally distributed. 

    b) The derivative work must be clearly identified as such, in
order that it may not be confused with the original work. 
     c) The
license under which the derivative work is distributed must expressly
prohibit the distribution of further derivative works.

4.
Modification and redistribution under open license. 
You may modify
your copy or copies of the Program, and distribute the resulting
derivative works, provided that you meet the following conditions: 

 
   a) The copyright notice and disclaimer on the Program must be
reproduced and included in the source code, documentation, and/or
other materials provided in a manner in which such notices are
normally distributed.

and date of any changes made to the Program. The full details need not
necessarily be included in the individual modified files, provided
that each modified file is clearly marked as such and instructions are
included on where the full details of the modifications may be found.

     c) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that
in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
parties under the terms of this License.

5. Implied acceptance. 
You
may not copy or distribute the Program or any derivative works except
as expressly provided under this license. Consequently, any such
action will be taken as implied acceptance of the terms of this
license.

6. NO WARRANTY. 
THIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED ""AS IS"" AND ANY
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY
OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS
PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,

READ THIS DOCUMENT CAREFULLY AND IN ITS ENTIRETY. THE ACCOMPANYING

License Background

Computer
Associates International, Inc. (CA) believes in open source. We
believe that the open source development approach can take appropriate
software programs to unprecedented levels of quality, growth, and
innovation. To demonstrate our continuing commitment to open source,
we are releasing the Program (as defined below) under this
License.

This License is intended to permit contributors and
recipients of the Program to use the Program, including its source
code, freely and without many of the concerns of some other open
source licenses. Although we expect the underlying Program, and
Contributions (as defined below) made to such Program, to remain open,
this License is designed to permit you to maintain your own software
programs free of this License unless you choose to do so. Thus, only
your Contributions to the Program must be distributed under the terms
of this License.

The provisions that follow set forth the terms and
conditions under which you may use the Program.

1. DEFINITIONS

1.1
Contribution means (a) in the case of CA, the Original Program; and
(b) in the case of each Contributor (including CA), changes and
additions to the Program, where such changes and/or additions to the
Program originate from and are distributed by that particular
Contributor to unaffiliated third parties. A Contribution originates
from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor
itself or anyone acting on such Contributors behalf. Contributions do
not include additions to the Program which: (x) are separate modules
of software distributed in conjunction with the Program under their
own license agreement, and (y) are not derivative works of the
Program.

1.2 Contributor means CA and any other person or entity that
distributes the Program.

1.3 Contributor Version means as to a

2. GRANT OF RIGHTS

2.1 Subject to the
terms of this License, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient an
irrevocable, non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to
reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly
perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such
Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and
object code form. For the avoidance of doubt, the license provided in
this Section 2.1 shall not include a license to any Licensed Patents
of a Contributor.

2.2 Subject to the terms of this License, each
Contributor hereby grants Recipient an irrevocable, non-exclusive,
worldwide, royalty-free license to the Licensed Patents to the extent
necessary to make, use, sell, offer to sell and import the
Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object
code form. The license granted in this Section 2.2 shall apply to the
combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the
Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the
Contribution causes the Licensed Patents to be infringed by such
combination. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no license is granted
under this Section 2.2: (a) for any code or works that do not include
the Contributor Version, as it exists and is used in accordance with
the terms hereof; (b) for infringements caused by: (i) third party
modifications of the Contributor Version; or (ii) the combination of
Contributions made by each such Contributor with other software
(except as part of the Contributor Version) or other devices; or (c)
with respect to Licensed Patents infringed by the Program in the
absence of Contributions made by that Contributor.

2.3 Recipient
understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its
Contributions set forth herein, except as provided in Section 2.4, no
assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not
infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other
person or entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to
Recipient for claims brought by any other person or entity based on
infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a
condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder,
each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other
intellectual property rights needed, if any.

2.4 Each Contributor
represents and warrants that it has all right, title and interest in
the copyrights in its Contributions, and has the right to grant the
copyright licenses set forth in this License.

3. DISTRIBUTION
REQUIREMENTS

3.1 If the Program is distributed in object code form,
then a prominent notice must be included in the code itself as well as
in any related documentation, stating that the source code for the
Program is available from the Contributor with information on how and
where to obtain the source code. A Contributor may choose to
distribute the Program in object code form under its own license
agreement, provided that:

     * it complies with the terms and
conditions of this License; and
     * its license agreement:
        
 * effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties
and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or
conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or
conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose, to
the maximum extent permitted by applicable law;
          *
effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for
damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and
consequential damages, such as lost profits, to the maximum extent
permitted by applicable law;
          * states that any provisions
which are inconsistent with this License are offered by that
Contributor alone and not by any other party; and
          * states
that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor at
the cost of distribution, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a
reasonable manner.
   
3.2 When the Program is made available in
source code form:

     * it must be made available under this
License; and
     * a copy of this License must be included with each
copy of the Program.
 
3.3 This License is intended to facilitate the
commercial distribution of the Program by any Contributor. However,
Contributors may only charge Recipients a one-time, upfront fee for
the distribution of the Program. Contributors may not charge
Recipients any recurring charge, license fee, or any ongoing royalty
for the Recipients exercise of its rights under this License to the
Program. Contributors shall make the source code for the Contributor
Version they distribute available at a cost, if any, equal to the cost
to the Contributor to physically copy and distribute the work. It is
not the intent of this License to prohibit a Contributor from charging
fees for any service or maintenance that a Contributor may charge to a
Recipient, so long as such fees are not an attempt to circumvent the
foregoing restrictions on charging royalties or other recurring fees
for the Program itself.

3.4 A Contributor may create a Larger Work by
combining the Program with other software code not governed by the
terms of this License, and distribute the Larger Work as a single
product. In such a case, the Contributor must make sure that the
requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Program. Any
Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering,
including as part of a Larger Work, may subject itself, but not any
other Contributor, to additional contractual commitments, including,
but not limited to, performance warranties and non-infringement
representations on suchContributors behalf. No Contributor may create
any additional liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a
Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering,
such Contributor (Commercial Contributor) hereby agrees to defend and
indemnify every other Contributor (Indemnified Contributor) who made
Contributions to the Program distributed by the Commercial Contributor
against any losses, damages and costs (collectively Losses) arising
from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party
against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts
or omissions, including any additional contractual commitments, of
such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the
Program. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or
Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property
infringement.

3.5 If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a
third partys intellectual property rights is required to exercise the
rights granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2,
Contributor must (a) include a text file with the Program source code
distribution titled ../IP_ISSUES, and (b) notify CA in writing at
Computer Associates International, Inc., One Computer Associates
Plaza, Islandia, New York 11749, Attn: Open Source Group or by email
at opensource@ca.com, both describing the claim and the party making
the claim in sufficient detail that a Recipient and CA will know whom
to contact with regard to such matter. If Contributor obtains such
knowledge after the Contribution is made available, Contributor shall
also promptly modify the IP_ISSUES file in all copies Contributor
makes available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as
notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably
calculated to inform those who received the Program that such new
knowledge has been obtained.

3.6 Recipient shall not remove, obscure,
or modify any CA or other Contributor copyright or patent proprietary
notices appearing in the Program, whether in the source code, object
code or in any documentation. In addition to the obligations set forth
in Section 4, each Contributor must identify itself as the originator
of its Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows
subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the
Contribution.

4. CONTRIBUTION RESTRICTIONS

4.1 Each Contributor must
cause the Program to which the Contributor provides a Contribution to
contain a file documenting the changes the Contributor made to create
its version of the Program and the date of any change. Each
Contributor must also include a prominent statement that the
Contribution is derived, directly or indirectly, from the Program
distributed by a prior Contributor, including the name of the prior
Contributor from which such Contribution was derived, in (a) the
Program source code, and (b) in any notice in an executable version or
related documentation in which the Contributor describes the origin or
ownership of the Program.

5. NO WARRANTY

5.1 EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET
FORTH IN THIS LICENSE, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED AS IS AND IN ITS
PRESENT STATE AND CONDITION. NO WARRANTY, REPRESENTATION, CONDITION,
UNDERTAKING OR TERM, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, AS TO
THE CONDITION, QUALITY, DURABILITY, PERFORMANCE, NON-INFRINGEMENT,
MERCHANTABILITY, OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR USE OF THE
PROGRAM IS GIVEN OR ASSUMED BY ANY CONTRIBUTOR AND ALL SUCH
WARRANTIES, REPRESENTATIONS, CONDITIONS, UNDERTAKINGS AND TERMS ARE
HEREBY EXCLUDED TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.

5.2 Each
Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of
using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated
with its exercise of rights under this License, including but not
limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with
applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and
unavailability or interruption of operations.

5.3 Each Recipient
acknowledges that the Program is not intended for use in the operation
of nuclear facilities, aircraft navigation, communication systems, or
air traffic control machines in which case the failure of the Program
could lead to death, personal injury, or severe physical or
environmental damage.

6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY

6.1 EXCEPT AS
EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS LICENSE, AND TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
LAW, NO CONTRIBUTOR SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT,
INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING
WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF
LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING
NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR
DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED
HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7.
TRADEMARKS AND BRANDING

7.1 This License does not grant any Recipient
or any third party any rights to use the trademarks or trade names now
or subsequently posted at http://www.ca.com/catrdmrk.htm, or any other
trademarks, service marks, logos or trade names belonging to CA
(collectively CA Marks) or to any trademark, service mark, logo or
trade name belonging to any Contributor. Recipient agrees not to use
any CA Marks in or as part of the name of products derived from the
Original Program or to endorse or promote products derived from the
Original Program.

7.2 Subject to Section 7.1, Recipients may
distribute the Program under trademarks, logos, and product names
belonging to the Recipient provided that all copyright and other
attribution notices remain in the Program.

8. PATENT LITIGATION

8.1
If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any person or entity
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other
software or hardware) infringes such Recipients patent(s), then such
Recipients rights granted under Section 2.2 shall terminate as of the
date such litigation is filed.

9. OWNERSHIP

9.1 Subject to the
licenses granted under this License in Sections 2.1 and 2.2 above,
each Contributor retains all rights, title and interest in and to any
Contributions made by such Contributor. CA retains all rights, title
and interest in and to the Original Program and any Contributions made
by or on behalf of CA (CA Contributions), and such CA Contributions
will not be automatically subject to this License. CA may, at its sole
discretion, choose to license such CA Contributions under this
License, or on different terms from those contained in this License or
may choose not to license them at all.

10. TERMINATION

10.1 All of
Recipients rights under this License shall terminate if it fails to
comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this License
and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after
becoming aware of such noncompliance. If Recipients rights under this
License terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of
the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipients
obligations under this License and any licenses granted by Recipient
as a Contributor relating to the Program shall continue and survive
termination.

11. GENERAL

11.1 If any provision of this License is
invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the
validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this
License, and without further action by the parties hereto, such
provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make
such provision valid and enforceable.

11.2 CA may publish new
versions (including revisions) of this License from time to time. Each
new version of the License will be given a distinguishing version
number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be
distributed subject to the version of the License under which it was
received. In addition, after a new version of the License is
published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including
its Contributions) under the new version. No one other than CA has the
right to modify this License.

11.3 If it is impossible for Recipient
to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some
or all of the Program due to statute, judicial order, or regulation,
then Recipient must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the
maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code
they affect. Such description must be included in the IP_ISSUES file
described in Section 3.5 and must be included with all distributions
of the Program source code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute
or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a
Recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.

11.4 This
License is governed by the laws of the State of New York. No Recipient
will bring a legal action under this License more than one year after
the cause of action arose. Each Recipient waives its rights to a jury
trial in any resulting litigation. Any litigation or other dispute
resolution between a Recipient and CA relating to this License shall
take place in the State of New York, and Recipient and CA hereby
consent to the personal jurisdiction of, and venue in, the state and
federal courts within that district with respect to this License. The
application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the
International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.

11.5 Where

parties contractantes confirment qu'elles ont exige que le present
contrat et tous les documents associes soient rediges en

the Program in violation of such laws, restrictions or regulations, or
without any necessary licenses and authorizations.

constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to

a work, such as a periodical issue, anthology or encyclopedia, in
which the Work in its entirety in unmodified form, along with a number
of other contributions, constituting separate and independent works in

constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work
(as defined below) for the purposes of this License.

     b.
""Derivative Work"" means a work based upon the Work or upon the Work
and other pre-existing works, such as a translation, musical
arrangement, dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture version,
sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment, condensation, or any
other form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted,
except that a work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be
considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License.

     c.
""Licensor"" means the individual or entity that offers the Work under
the terms of this License.

     d. ""Original Author"" means the
individual or entity who created the Work.

copyrightable work of authorship offered under the terms of this
License.

rights under this License who has not previously violated the terms of
this License with respect to the Work, or who has received express
permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License
despite a previous violation.

2. Fair Use Rights. Nothing in this
license is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any rights arising
from fair use, first sale or other limitations on the exclusive rights
of the copyright owner under copyright law or other applicable
laws.

3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
License, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable
copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work as stated
below:

one or more Collective Works, and to reproduce the Work as
incorporated in the Collective Works;

     b. to create and reproduce
Derivative Works;

     c. to distribute copies or phonorecords of,
display publicly, perform publicly, and perform publicly by means of a
digital audio transmission the Work including as incorporated in
Collective Works;

     d. to distribute copies or phonorecords of,

digital audio transmission Derivative Works;

The above rights may be
exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter
devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications
as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and
formats. All rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby
reserved.

4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is
expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:


    a. You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or
publicly digitally perform the Work only under the terms of this
License, and You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource
Identifier for, this License with every copy or phonorecord of the
Work You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly
digitally perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work
that alter or restrict the terms of this License or the recipients'
exercise of the rights granted hereunder. You may not sublicense the
Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and
to the disclaimer of warranties. You may not distribute, publicly
display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work with
any technological measures that control access or use of the Work in a
manner inconsistent with the terms of this License Agreement. The
above applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collective Work, but
this does not require the Collective Work apart from the Work itself
to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a
Collective Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent
practicable, remove from the Collective Work any reference to such
Licensor or the Original Author, as requested. If You create a
Derivative Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent
practicable, remove from the Derivative Work any reference to such
Licensor or the Original Author, as requested.

     b. If you
distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally

conveying the name (or pseudonym if applicable) of the Original Author
if supplied; the title of the Work if supplied; in the case of a
Derivative Work, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the
Derivative Work (e.g., ""French translation of the Work by Original
Author,"" or ""Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author"").
Such credit may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided,
however, that in the case of a Derivative Work or Collective Work, at
a minimum such credit will appear where any other comparable
authorship credit appears and in a manner at least as prominent as
such other comparable authorship credit.

5. Representations,
Warranties and Disclaimer

     a. By offering the Work for public
release under this License, Licensor represents and warrants that, to
the best of Licensor's knowledge after reasonable inquiry:

         
i. Licensor has secured all rights in the Work necessary to grant the

publicity rights, common law rights or any other right of any third
party or constitute defamation, invasion of privacy or other tortious
injury to any third party.

LICENSE OR OTHERWISE AGREED IN WRITING OR REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW,
THE WORK IS LICENSED ON AN ""AS IS"" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY
KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY
WARRANTIES REGARDING THE CONTENTS OR ACCURACY OF THE WORK.

LAW, AND EXCEPT FOR DAMAGES ARISING FROM LIABILITY TO A THIRD PARTY
RESULTING FROM BREACH OF THE WARRANTIES IN SECTION 5, IN NO EVENT WILL

automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License.
Individuals or entities who have received Derivative Works or
Collective Works from You under this License, however, will not have
their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain
in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8
will survive any termination of this License.

     b. Subject to the
above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for
the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding
the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under
different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time;
provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw
this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to
be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will
continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated
above.

8. Miscellaneous

     a. Each time You distribute or publicly

or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and
without further action by the parties to this agreement, such
provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make
such provision valid and enforceable.

distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally
perform the Work only under the terms of this License, and You must
include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this
License with every copy or phonorecord of the Work You distribute,
publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform. You
may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that alter or restrict
the terms of this License or the recipients' exercise of the rights
granted hereunder. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep
intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of
warranties. You may not distribute, publicly display, publicly
perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work with any technological
measures that control access or use of the Work in a manner
inconsistent with the terms of this License Agreement. The above
applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collective Work, but this
does not require the Collective Work apart from the Work itself to be
made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collective
Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent
practicable, remove from the Collective Work any reference to such
Licensor or the Original Author, as requested. If You create a
Derivative Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent
practicable, remove from the Derivative Work any reference to such
Licensor or the Original Author, as requested.

     b. If you
distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally
perform the Work or any Derivative Works or Collective Works, You must
keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and give the Original
Author credit reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing by
conveying the name (or pseudonym if applicable) of the Original Author
if supplied; the title of the Work if supplied; to the extent
reasonably practicable, the Uniform Resource Identifier, if any, that
Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI
does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for
the Work; and in the case of a Derivative Work, a credit identifying
the use of the Work in the Derivative Work (e.g., ""French translation
of the Work by Original Author,"" or ""Screenplay based on original Work
by Original Author""). Such credit may be implemented in any reasonable
manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Derivative Work or
Collective Work, at a minimum such credit will appear where any other
comparable authorship credit appears and in a manner at least as
prominent as such other comparable authorship credit.

LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY

Termination

5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.

     b.
Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is
perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work).
Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the
Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at
any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to
withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is
required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this
License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as
stated above.

8. Miscellaneous

     a. Each time You distribute or
publicly digitally perform the Work or a Collective Work, the Licensor
offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and

Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform a Derivative
Work, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work
on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under
this License.

     c. If any provision of this License is invalid or
unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity
or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and
without further action by the parties to this agreement, such
provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make
such provision valid and enforceable.

this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless
such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to

License

THE
WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE
COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE (""CCPL"" OR ""LICENSE""). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY
COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN
AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.

BY
EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE
TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE
RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH
TERMS AND CONDITIONS.

1. Definitions

     a. ""Collective Work"" means
a work, such as a periodical issue, anthology or encyclopedia, in
which the Work in its entirety in unmodified form, along with a number
of other contributions, constituting separate and independent works in
themselves, are assembled into a collective whole. A work that
constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work
(as defined below) for the purposes of this License.

     b.
""Derivative Work"" means a work based upon the Work or upon the Work
and other pre-existing works, such as a translation, musical
arrangement, dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture version,
sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment, condensation, or any
other form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted,
except that a work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be
considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License. For the
avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical composition or sound
recording, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a
moving image (""synching"") will be considered a Derivative Work for the
purpose of this License.

     c. ""Licensor"" means the individual or
entity that offers the Work under the terms of this License.

     d.
""Original Author"" means the individual or entity who created the
Work.

     e. ""Work"" means the copyrightable work of authorship
offered under the terms of this License.

     f. ""You"" means an
individual or entity exercising rights under this License who has not
previously violated the terms of this License with respect to the
Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to
exercise rights under this License despite a previous violation.

2.
Fair Use Rights. Nothing in this license is intended to reduce, limit,
or restrict any rights arising from fair use, first sale or other
limitations on the exclusive rights of the copyright owner under
copyright law or other applicable laws.

3. License Grant. Subject to
the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants You a
worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of
the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work
as stated below:

     a. to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the
Work into one or more Collective Works, and to reproduce the Work as
incorporated in the Collective Works;

     b. to create and reproduce
Derivative Works;

     c. to distribute copies or phonorecords of,
display publicly, perform publicly, and perform publicly by means of a
digital audio transmission the Work including as incorporated in
Collective Works;

     d. to distribute copies or phonorecords of,
display publicly, perform publicly, and perform publicly by means of a
digital audio transmission Derivative Works.

     e. For the
avoidance of doubt, where the work is a musical composition:

        
 i. Performance Royalties Under Blanket Licenses. Licensor waives the
exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a performance
rights society (e.g. ASCAP, BMI, SESAC), royalties for the public
performance or public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the
Work.

          ii. Mechanical Rights and Statutory Royalties.
Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect, whether individually
or via a music rights agency or designated agent (e.g. Harry Fox
Agency), royalties for any phonorecord You create from the Work
(""cover version"") and distribute, subject to the compulsory license
created by 17 USC Section 115 of the US Copyright Act (or the
equivalent in other jurisdictions).

     f. Webcasting Rights and
Statutory Royalties. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a
sound recording, Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect,
whether individually or via a performance-rights society (e.g.
SoundExchange), royalties for the public digital performance (e.g.
webcast) of the Work, subject to the compulsory license created by 17
USC Section 114 of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other
jurisdictions). 

The above rights may be exercised in all media and
formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above rights
include the right to make such modifications as are technically
necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats. All
rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.

4.
Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made
subject to and limited by the following restrictions:

     a. You may
distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally
perform the Work only under the terms of this License, and You must
include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this
License with every copy or phonorecord of the Work You distribute,

warranties. You may not distribute, publicly display, publicly
perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work with any technological
measures that control access or use of the Work in a manner
inconsistent with the terms of this License Agreement. The above
applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collective Work, but this
does not require the Collective Work apart from the Work itself to be
made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collective
Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent
practicable, remove from the Collective Work any credit as required by
clause 4(b), as requested. If You create a Derivative Work, upon
notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove
from the Derivative Work any credit as required by clause 4(b), as
requested.

     b. If you distribute, publicly display, publicly

for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are
utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if
applicable) if supplied, and/or (ii) if the Original Author and/or
Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g. a sponsor institute,
publishing entity, journal) for attribution in Licensor's copyright
notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of
such party or parties; the title of the Work if supplied; to the
extent reasonably practicable, the Uniform Resource Identifier, if
any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless
such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing
information for the Work; and in the case of a Derivative Work, a
credit identifying the use of the Work in the Derivative Work (e.g.,
""French translation of the Work by Original Author,"" or ""Screenplay
based on original Work by Original Author""). Such credit may be
implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the
case of a Derivative Work or Collective Work, at a minimum such credit
will appear where any other comparable authorship credit appears and
in a manner at least as prominent as such other comparable authorship
credit.

reserves the right to release the Work under different license terms

derivative work, arrangement of music or other alterations of a
literary or artistic work, or phonogram or performance and includes
cinematographic adaptations or any other form in which the Work may be
recast, transformed, or adapted including in any form recognizably
derived from the original, except that a work that constitutes a
Collection will not be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of

which the Work is included in its entirety in unmodified form along

performance the actors, singers, musicians, dancers, and other persons
who act, sing, deliver, declaim, play in, interpret or otherwise
perform literary or artistic works or expressions of folklore; (ii) in

uses free from copyright or rights arising from limitations or
exceptions that are provided for in connection with the copyright
protection under copyright law or other applicable laws.

3. License
Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor
hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual
(for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the
rights in the Work as stated below:

     a. to Reproduce the Work, to
incorporate the Work into one or more Collections, and to Reproduce
the Work as incorporated in the Collections;

     b. to create and
Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such Adaptation, including any
translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps to clearly label,
demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made to the original
Work. For example, a translation could be marked ""The original work
was translated from English to Spanish,"" or a modification could
indicate ""The original work has been modified."";

     c. to
Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated in
Collections; and,

     d. to Distribute and Publicly Perform
Adaptations.

     e. For the avoidance of doubt:

          i.

compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves
the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You
of the rights granted under this License;

          ii. Waivable
Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right
to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing
scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the exclusive right to
collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted
under this License; and,

          iii. Voluntary License Schemes.
The Licensor waives the right to collect royalties, whether
individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a member of a
collecting society that administers voluntary licensing schemes, via
that society, from any exercise by You of the rights granted under
this License.

The above rights may be exercised in all media and
formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above rights
include the right to make such modifications as are technically
necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats. Subject
to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly granted by Licensor are
hereby reserved. 

4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3
above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following
restrictions:

     a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work
only under the terms of this License. You must include a copy of, or
the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every
copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer
or impose any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this
License or the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the
rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. You
may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that
refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every
copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You
Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any
effective technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability
of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to
that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a)
applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not
require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made subject
to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection, upon notice
from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the
Collection any credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested. If
You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to
the extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as
required by Section 4(b), as requested.

     b. If You Distribute, or
Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or Collections, You must,
unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact
all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the
medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author
(or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original
Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a
sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution
(""Attribution Parties"") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of
service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or
parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent
reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be
associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the
copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and (iv) ,
consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a credit
identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., ""French
translation of the Work by Original Author,"" or ""Screenplay based on
original Work by Original Author""). The credit required by this
Section 4 (b) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided,
however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum
such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of
the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these credits
and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other
contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the
credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the
manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this
License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any
connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author,
Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your
use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written
permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution
Parties.

     c. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the
Licensor or as may be otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You
Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or
as part of any Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort,
mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in relation to the
Work which would be prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or
reputation. Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan),
in which any exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this
License (the right to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a
distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory action
prejudicial to the Original Author's honor and reputation, the
Licensor will waive or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to
the fullest extent permitted by the applicable national law, to enable
You to reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this
License (right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise.

DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR
NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF
IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

6.
Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE
LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY
FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY
DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF
LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7.
Termination

     a. This License and the rights granted hereunder
will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of
this License. Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or
Collections from You under this License, however, will not have their
licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in
full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8
will survive any termination of this License.

     b. Subject to the
above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for
the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding
the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under
different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time;
provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw
this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to
be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will
continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated
above.

8. Miscellaneous

     a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly
Perform the Work or a Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient
a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license
granted to You under this License.

     b. Each time You Distribute
or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor offers to the recipient a
license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the
license granted to You under this License.

     c. If any provision
of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it
shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of
the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties
to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum
extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.

    
d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no
breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing
and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.
This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with
respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings,
agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified
here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that
may appear in any communication from You.

     e. This License may
not be modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor
and You.

     f. The rights granted under, and the subject matter
referenced, in this License were drafted utilizing the terminology of
the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works
(as amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the
WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms
Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on
July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter take effect in the
relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be
enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the
implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable national
law. If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable
copyright law includes additional rights not granted under this
License, such additional rights are deemed to be included in the
License; this License is not intended to restrict the license of any
rights under applicable law.

Corporation (“Creative Commons”) is not a law firm and does not
provide legal services or legal advice. Distribution of Creative

relationship. Creative Commons makes its licenses and related

Using Creative Commons Public
Licenses

Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of
terms and conditions that creators and other rights holders may use to
share original works of authorship and other material subject to
copyright and certain other rights specified in the public license
below. The following considerations are for informational purposes
only, are not exhaustive, and do not form part of our
licenses.

Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are
intended for use by those authorized to give the public permission to
use material in ways otherwise restricted by copyright and certain
other rights. Our licenses are irrevocable. Licensors should read and
understand the terms and conditions of the license they choose before
applying it. Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before
applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the material as
expected. Licensors should clearly mark any material not subject to
the license. This includes other CC-licensed material, or material
used under an exception or limitation to copyright. More
considerations for licensors.

Considerations for the public: By using
one of our public licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to
use the licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If the
licensor’s permission is not necessary for any reason–for example,
because of any applicable exception or limitation to copyright–then
that use is not regulated by the license. Our licenses grant only
permissions under copyright and certain other rights that a licensor
has authority to grant. Use of the licensed material may still be
restricted for other reasons, including because others have copyright
or other rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests,
such as asking that all changes be marked or described. Although not
required by our licenses, you are encouraged to respect those requests
where reasonable. More considerations for the public. 

Creative
Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License

By exercising
the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree to be bound
by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons Attribution 4.0
International Public License (""Public License""). To the extent this
Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are granted the
Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of these terms and
conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in consideration
of benefits the Licensor receives from making the Licensed Material
available under these terms and conditions.

Section 1 –
Definitions.
     
     a.	Adapted Material means material subject to
Copyright and Similar Rights that is derived from or based upon the
Licensed Material and in which the Licensed Material is translated,
altered, arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner
requiring permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by
the Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed
Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording, Adapted
Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is synched in
timed relation with a moving image.
	
     b.	Adapter's License means
the license You apply to Your Copyright and Similar Rights in Your
contributions to Adapted Material in accordance with the terms and
conditions of this Public License.
	
     c.	Copyright and Similar
Rights means copyright and/or similar rights closely related to
copyright including, without limitation, performance, broadcast, sound
recording, and Sui Generis Database Rights, without regard to how the
rights are labeled or categorized. For purposes of this Public
License, the rights specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright
and Similar Rights.
	
     d.	Effective Technological Measures means
those measures that, in the absence of proper authority, may not be
circumvented under laws fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the
WIPO Copyright Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar
international agreements.
	
     e.	Exceptions and Limitations means
fair use, fair dealing, and/or any other exception or limitation to
Copyright and Similar Rights that applies to Your use of the Licensed
Material.
	
     f.	Licensed Material means the artistic or literary
work, database, or other material to which the Licensor applied this
Public License.
	
     g.	Licensed Rights means the rights granted to
You subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, which
are limited to all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use
of the Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to
license.
	
     h.	Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies)
granting rights under this Public License.
	
     i.	Share means to
provide material to the public by any means or process that requires
permission under the Licensed Rights, such as reproduction, public
display, public performance, distribution, dissemination,
communication, or importation, and to make material available to the
public including in ways that members of the public may access the
material from a place and at a time individually chosen by them.
	
   
 j.	Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright
resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the
Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, as
amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially equivalent
rights anywhere in the world.
	
     k.	You means the individual or
entity exercising the Licensed Rights under this Public License. Your
has a corresponding meaning.

Section 2 – Scope.
	
     a.	License
grant.
	
          1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Public License, the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide,
royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to
exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:

           
   A. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part;
and     

               B. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted
Material.

          2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance
of doubt, where Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this
Public License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with its
terms and conditions.
	
          3. Term. The term of this Public
License is specified in Section 6(a).
	
          4. Media and
formats; technical modifications allowed. The Licensor authorizes You
to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats whether now
known or hereafter created, and to make technical modifications
necessary to do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert
any right or authority to forbid You from making technical
modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including
technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective
Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License, simply
making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)(4) never produces
Adapted Material.
	
          5. Downstream recipients.

             
 A. Offer from the Licensor – Licensed Material. Every recipient of
the Licensed Material automatically receives an offer from the
Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights under the terms and
conditions of this Public License.

               B. No downstream
restrictions. You may not offer or impose any additional or different
terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures
to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the
Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed Material.
	
         
6.  No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may
be construed as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that
Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected with, or sponsored,
endorsed, or granted official status by, the Licensor or others
designated to receive attribution as provided in Section
3(a)(1)(A)(i).
	
b. Other rights.

          1. Moral rights, such as
the right of integrity, are not licensed under this Public License,
nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar personality rights;
however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not
to assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited extent
necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights, but not
otherwise.
	
          2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed
under this Public License.
	
          3. To the extent possible, the
Licensor waives any right to collect royalties from You for the
exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether directly or through a
collecting society under any voluntary or waivable statutory or
compulsory licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly
reserves any right to collect such royalties.   

Section 3 –
License Conditions.

Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly
made subject to the following conditions.
	
     a.	Attribution.
	
   
      1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified
form), You must:

               A. retain the following if it is
supplied by the Licensor with the Licensed Material:

                
   i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed Material and
any others designated to receive attribution, in any reasonable manner
requested by the Licensor (including by pseudonym if designated);

   
                ii. a copyright notice;

                    iii. a
notice that refers to this Public License;

                    iv.	a
notice that refers to the disclaimer of warranties;

                 
  v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the extent
reasonably practicable;

               B. indicate if You modified
the Licensed Material and retain an indication of any previous
modifications; and
	
               C. indicate the Licensed Material
is licensed under this Public License, and include the text of, or the
URI or hyperlink to, this Public License.
	
          2. You may
satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any reasonable manner
based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share the
Licensed Material. For example, it may be reasonable to satisfy the
conditions by providing a URI or hyperlink to a resource that includes
the required information.
	
          3. If requested by the Licensor,
You must remove any of the information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A)
to the extent reasonably practicable.
	
          4. If You Share
Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's License You apply must not
prevent recipients of the Adapted Material from complying with this
Public License.

Section 4 – Sui Generis Database Rights.

Where the
Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your
use of the Licensed Material:
	
     a.	for the avoidance of doubt,
Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to extract, reuse, reproduce, and
Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database;
	

    b.	if You include all or a substantial portion of the database
contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights,
then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but
not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and
	
     c.	You
must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all or a
substantial portion of the contents of the database.
For the avoidance
of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace Your
obligations under this Public License where the Licensed Rights
include other Copyright and Similar Rights.

Section 5 – Disclaimer
of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.
	
     a.	Unless otherwise
separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent possible, the
Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available, and
makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the
Licensed Material, whether express, implied, statutory, or other. This
includes, without limitation, warranties of title, merchantability,
fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent
or other defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence of errors,
whether or not known or discoverable. Where disclaimers of warranties
are not allowed in full or in part, this disclaimer may not apply to
You.
	
     b.	To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor
be liable to You on any legal theory (including, without limitation,
negligence) or otherwise for any direct, special, indirect,
incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary, or other losses,
costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this Public License or use
of the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor has been advised of the
possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where a
limitation of liability is not allowed in full or in part, this
limitation may not apply to You.
	
     c.	The disclaimer of
warranties and limitation of liability provided above shall be
interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely
approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all
liability.

Section 6 – Term and Termination.
	
     a.	This Public
License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights
licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public
License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate
automatically.
	
     b.	Where Your right to use the Licensed Material
has terminated under Section 6(a), it reinstates:
	
          1.
automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is
cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or
	
        
 2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.
	
     c.	For the
avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the
Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public
License.
	
     d.	For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also
offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop
distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will
not terminate this Public License.
	
     e.	Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and
8 survive termination of this Public License.

Section 7 – Other
Terms and Conditions.
	
     a.	The Licensor shall not be bound by any
additional or different terms or conditions communicated by You unless
expressly agreed.
	
     b.	Any arrangements, understandings, or
agreements regarding the Licensed Material not stated herein are
separate from and independent of the terms and conditions of this
Public License.

Section 8 – Interpretation.
	
     a.	For the
avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not be
interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any
use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without
permission under this Public License.
	
     b.	To the extent
possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed
unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum
extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be
reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License without
affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions.
	

    c.	No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and
no failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the
Licensor.
	
     d.	Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may
be interpreted as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and
immunities that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal
processes of any jurisdiction or authority.

License

THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF
THIS CREATIVE COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE (""CCPL"" OR ""LICENSE""). THE WORK
IS PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE
WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE IS PROHIBITED.

BY
EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE
TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE
RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH
TERMS AND CONDITIONS.

1. Definitions

     a. ""Collective Work"" means
a work, such as a periodical issue, anthology or encyclopedia, in
which the Work in its entirety in unmodified form, along with a number
of other contributions, constituting separate and independent works in
themselves, are assembled into a collective whole. A work that
constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work
(as defined below) for the purposes of this License.

      b.
""Derivative Work"" means a work based upon the Work or upon the Work
and other pre-existing works, such as a translation, musical
arrangement, dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture version,
sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment, condensation, or any
other form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted,
except that a work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be
considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License.

     c.
""Licensor"" means the individual or entity that offers the Work under
the terms of this License.

     d. ""Original Author"" means the
individual or entity who created the Work.

     e. ""Work"" means the
copyrightable work of authorship offered under the terms of this
License.

     f. ""You"" means an individual or entity exercising
rights under this License who has not previously violated the terms of
this License with respect to the Work, or who has received express
permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License
despite a previous violation.

2. Fair Use Rights. Nothing in this
license is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any rights arising
from fair use, first sale or other limitations on the exclusive rights
of the copyright owner under copyright law or other applicable
laws.

3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
License, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable
copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work as stated
below:

     a. to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into
one or more Collective Works, and to reproduce the Work as
incorporated in the Collective Works;

     b. to create and reproduce
Derivative Works;

     c. to distribute copies or phonorecords of,
display publicly, perform publicly, and perform publicly by means of a
digital audio transmission the Work including as incorporated in
Collective Works;

     d. to distribute copies or phonorecords of,
display publicly, perform publicly, and perform publicly by means of a
digital audio transmission Derivative Works;

The above rights may be
exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter
devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications
as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and
formats. All rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby
reserved.

4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is
expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:


    a. You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or
publicly digitally perform the Work only under the terms of this
License, and You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource
Identifier for, this License with every copy or phonorecord of the
Work You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly
digitally perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work
that alter or restrict the terms of this License or the recipients'
exercise of the rights granted hereunder. You may not sublicense the
Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and
to the disclaimer of warranties. You may not distribute, publicly
display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work with
any technological measures that control access or use of the Work in a
manner inconsistent with the terms of this License Agreement. The
above applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collective Work, but
this does not require the Collective Work apart from the Work itself
to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a
Collective Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent
practicable, remove from the Collective Work any reference to such
Licensor or the Original Author, as requested. If You create a
Derivative Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent
practicable, remove from the Derivative Work any reference to such
Licensor or the Original Author, as requested.

     b. You may not
exercise any of the rights granted to You in Section 3 above in any
manner that is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial
advantage or private monetary compensation. The exchange of the Work
for other copyrighted works by means of digital file-sharing or
otherwise shall not be considered to be intended for or directed
toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation, provided
there is no payment of any monetary compensation in connection with
the exchange of copyrighted works.

     c. If you distribute,
publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the
Work or any Derivative Works or Collective Works, You must keep intact
all copyright notices for the Work and give the Original Author credit
reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing by conveying the
name (or pseudonym if applicable) of the Original Author if supplied;
the title of the Work if supplied; in the case of a Derivative Work, a
credit identifying the use of the Work in the Derivative Work (e.g.,
""French translation of the Work by Original Author,"" or ""Screenplay
based on original Work by Original Author""). Such credit may be
implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the
case of a Derivative Work or Collective Work, at a minimum such credit
will appear where any other comparable authorship credit appears and
in a manner at least as prominent as such other comparable authorship
credit.

5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer

By offering
the Work for public release under this License, Licensor represents
and warrants that, to the best of Licensor's knowledge after
reasonable inquiry: Licensor has secured all rights in the Work
necessary to grant the license rights hereunder and to permit the
lawful exercise of the rights granted hereunder without You having any
obligation to pay any royalties, compulsory license fees, residuals or
any other payments; The Work does not infringe the copyright,
trademark, publicity rights, common law rights or any other right of
any third party or constitute defamation, invasion of privacy or other
tortious injury to any third party. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY STATED IN THIS
LICENSE OR OTHERWISE AGREED IN WRITING OR REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW,
THE WORK IS LICENSED ON AN ""AS IS"" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY
KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY
WARRANTIES REGARDING THE CONTENTS OR ACCURACY OF THE WORK.

6.

LAW, AND EXCEPT FOR DAMAGES ARISING FROM LIABILITY TO A THIRD PARTY
RESULTING FROM BREACH OF THE WARRANTIES IN SECTION 5, IN NO EVENT WILL
LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL,
INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT
OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN
ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. Termination

     a.
This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License.
Individuals or entities who have received Derivative Works or
Collective Works from You under this License, however, will not have
their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain
in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8
will survive any termination of this License.

     b. Subject to the
above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for
the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding
the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under
different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time;
provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw
this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to
be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will
continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated
above.

8. Miscellaneous

     a. Each time You distribute or publicly
digitally perform the Work or a Collective Work, the Licensor offers
to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and
conditions as the license granted to You under this License.

License

THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF
THIS CREATIVE COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE (""CCPL"" OR ""LICENSE""). THE WORK
IS PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE
WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS
PROHIBITED.

BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU
ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. THE
LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR
ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.

1. Definitions

     a.
""Collective Work"" means a work, such as a periodical issue, anthology
or encyclopedia, in which the Work in its entirety in unmodified form,
along with a number of other contributions, constituting separate and
independent works in themselves, are assembled into a collective
whole. A work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be
considered a Derivative Work (as defined below) for the purposes of
this License.

     b. ""Derivative Work"" means a work based upon the
Work or upon the Work and other pre-existing works, such as a
translation, musical arrangement, dramatization, fictionalization,
motion picture version, sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment,
condensation, or any other form in which the Work may be recast,
transformed, or adapted, except that a work that constitutes a
Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work for the
purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is
a musical composition or sound recording, the synchronization of the
Work in timed-relation with a moving image (""synching"") will be
considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License.

     c.
""Licensor"" means the individual or entity that offers the Work under
the terms of this License.

     d. ""Original Author"" means the
individual or entity who created the Work.

     e. ""Work"" means the
copyrightable work of authorship offered under the terms of this
License.

     f. ""You"" means an individual or entity exercising
rights under this License who has not previously violated the terms of
this License with respect to the Work, or who has received express
permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License
despite a previous violation.

2. Fair Use Rights. Nothing in this
license is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any rights arising
from fair use, first sale or other limitations on the exclusive rights
of the copyright owner under copyright law or other applicable
laws.

3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
License, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable
copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work as stated
below:

     a. to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into
one or more Collective Works, and to reproduce the Work as
incorporated in the Collective Works;

     b. to create and reproduce
Derivative Works;

     c. to distribute copies or phonorecords of,
display publicly, perform publicly, and perform publicly by means of a
digital audio transmission the Work including as incorporated in
Collective Works;

     d. to distribute copies or phonorecords of,
display publicly, perform publicly, and perform publicly by means of a
digital audio transmission Derivative Works;

The above rights may be
exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter
devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications
as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and
formats. All rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby
reserved, including but not limited to the rights set forth in
Sections 4(d) and 4(e).

4. Restrictions.The license granted in
Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the
following restrictions:

     a. You may distribute, publicly display,
publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work only under
the terms of this License, and You must include a copy of, or the
Uniform Resource Identifier for, this License with every copy or
phonorecord of the Work You distribute, publicly display, publicly
perform, or publicly digitally perform. You may not offer or impose
any terms on the Work that alter or restrict the terms of this License
or the recipients' exercise of the rights granted hereunder. You may
not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer
to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties. You may not
distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally
perform the Work with any technological measures that control access
or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with the terms of this
License Agreement. The above applies to the Work as incorporated in a
Collective Work, but this does not require the Collective Work apart
from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License.
If You create a Collective Work, upon notice from any Licensor You
must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collective Work any
reference to such Licensor or the Original Author, as requested. If
You create a Derivative Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must,
to the extent practicable, remove from the Derivative Work any
reference to such Licensor or the Original Author, as requested.

    
b. You may not exercise any of the rights granted to You in Section 3
above in any manner that is primarily intended for or directed toward
commercial advantage or private monetary compensation. The exchange of
the Work for other copyrighted works by means of digital file-sharing
or otherwise shall not be considered to be intended for or directed
toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation, provided
there is no payment of any monetary compensation in connection with
the exchange of copyrighted works.

     c. If you distribute,
publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the
Work or any Derivative Works or Collective Works, You must keep intact
all copyright notices for the Work and give the Original Author credit
reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing by conveying the
name (or pseudonym if applicable) of the Original Author if supplied;
the title of the Work if supplied; to the extent reasonably
practicable, the Uniform Resource Identifier, if any, that Licensor
specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not
refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work;
and in the case of a Derivative Work, a credit identifying the use of
the Work in the Derivative Work (e.g., ""French translation of the Work
by Original Author,"" or ""Screenplay based on original Work by Original
Author""). Such credit may be implemented in any reasonable manner;
provided, however, that in the case of a Derivative Work or Collective
Work, at a minimum such credit will appear where any other comparable
authorship credit appears and in a manner at least as prominent as
such other comparable authorship credit.

     d. For the avoidance of
doubt, where the Work is a musical composition: 

          i.
Performance Royalties Under Blanket Licenses. Licensor reserves the
exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a performance
rights society (e.g. ASCAP, BMI, SESAC), royalties for the public
performance or public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work
if that performance is primarily intended for or directed toward
commercial advantage or private monetary compensation.

          ii.
Mechanical Rights and Statutory Royalties. Licensor reserves the
exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a music rights
agency or designated agent (e.g. Harry Fox Agency), royalties for any
phonorecord You create from the Work (""cover version"") and distribute,
subject to the compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 115 of the
US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions), if Your
distribution of such cover version is primarily intended for or
directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation.
Webcasting Rights and Statutory Royalties. For the avoidance of doubt,
where the Work is a sound recording, Licensor reserves the exclusive
right to collect, whether individually or via a performance-rights
society (e.g. SoundExchange), royalties for the public digital
performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work, subject to the compulsory
license created by 17 USC Section 114 of the US Copyright Act (or the
equivalent in other jurisdictions), if Your public digital performance
is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or
private monetary compensation.

5. Representations, Warranties and
Disclaimer

UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN
WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS
OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED,
STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF
TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE,
NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY,
OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE.
SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES,
SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

6. Limitation on Liability.
EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL
LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL,
INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT
OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN
ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. Termination

     a.
This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License.
Individuals or entities who have received Derivative Works or
Collective Works from You under this License, however, will not have
their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain
in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8
will survive any termination of this License.

     b. Subject to the
above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for
the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding
the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under
different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time;
provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw
this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to
be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will
continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated
above.

8. Miscellaneous

     a. Each time You distribute or publicly
digitally perform the Work or a Collective Work, the Licensor offers
to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and
conditions as the license granted to You under this License.

     b.
Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform a Derivative
Work, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work
on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under
this License.

     c. If any provision of this License is invalid or
unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity
or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and
without further action by the parties to this agreement, such
provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make
such provision valid and enforceable.

     d. No term or provision of
this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless
such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to
be charged with such waiver or consent.

     e. This License
constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to
the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or
representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor
shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any
communication from You. This License may not be modified without the
mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.

and obligations of Licensor.

otherwise considered a literary or artistic work.

     g. ""You"" means
an individual or entity exercising rights under this License who has
not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to the
Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to
exercise rights under this License despite a previous violation.

    
h. ""Publicly Perform"" means to perform public recitations of the Work
and to communicate to the public those public recitations, by any
means or process, including by wire or wireless means or public

     i. ""Reproduce"" means to make copies of the
Work by any means including without limitation by sound or visual
recordings and the right of fixation and reproducing fixations of the
Work, including storage of a protected performance or phonogram in

2. Fair Dealing Rights.
Nothing in this License is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any
uses free from copyright or rights arising from limitations or
exceptions that are provided for in connection with the copyright
protection under copyright law or other applicable laws.

3. License
Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor
hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual
(for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the
rights in the Work as stated below:

     a. to Reproduce the Work, to
incorporate the Work into one or more Collections, and to Reproduce
the Work as incorporated in the Collections;

     b. to create and
Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such Adaptation, including any
translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps to clearly label,
demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made to the original
Work. For example, a translation could be marked ""The original work
was translated from English to Spanish,"" or a modification could
indicate ""The original work has been modified."";

     c. to
Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated in
Collections; and,

     d. to Distribute and Publicly Perform
Adaptations.

The above rights may be exercised in all media and
formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above rights
include the right to make such modifications as are technically
necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats. Subject
to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly granted by Licensor are
hereby reserved, including but not limited to the rights set forth in
Section 4(d).

4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above
is expressly made subject to and limited by the following
restrictions:

     a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work
only under the terms of this License. You must include a copy of, or
the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every
copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer
or impose any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this
License or the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the
rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. You
may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that
refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every
copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You
Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any
effective technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability
of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to
that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a)
applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not
require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made subject
to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection, upon notice
from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the
Collection any credit as required by Section 4(c), as requested. If
You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to
the extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as
required by Section 4(c), as requested.

     b. You may not exercise
any of the rights granted to You in Section 3 above in any manner that
is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or
private monetary compensation. The exchange of the Work for other
copyrighted works by means of digital file-sharing or otherwise shall
not be considered to be intended for or directed toward commercial
advantage or private monetary compensation, provided there is no
payment of any monetary compensation in connection with the exchange
of copyrighted works.

     c. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform
the Work or any Adaptations or Collections, You must, unless a request
has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright
notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means
You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym,
if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or
Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor
institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution (""Attribution
Parties"") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other
reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of
the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the
URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work,
unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing
information for the Work; and, (iv) consistent with Section 3(b), in
the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in
the Adaptation (e.g., ""French translation of the Work by Original
Author,"" or ""Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author"").
The credit required by this Section 4(c) may be implemented in any
reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation
or Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for
all contributing authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then
as part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the
credits for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of
doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section for the
purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising
Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly
assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the
Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate,
of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express prior
written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution
Parties.

     d. For the avoidance of doubt:

          i.
Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in
which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or
compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves
the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You
of the rights granted under this License;

          ii. Waivable
Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right
to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing
scheme can be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to
collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted
under this License if Your exercise of such rights is for a purpose or
use which is otherwise than noncommercial as permitted under Section
4(b) and otherwise waives the right to collect royalties through any
statutory or compulsory licensing scheme; and,

          iii.
Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor reserves the right to collect
royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is
a member of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing
schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the rights
granted under this License that is for a purpose or use which is
otherwise than noncommercial as permitted under Section 4(c).

     e.
Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be
otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or
Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any
Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or
take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be
prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or reputation. Licensor
agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise
of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to
make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation,
modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original
Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert,
as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the
applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your
right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations)
but not otherwise.

5. Representations, Warranties and
Disclaimer

UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN
WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS
OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED,
STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF
TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE,
NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY,
OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE.
SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES,
SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

6. Limitation on Liability.
EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL
LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL,
INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT
OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN
ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. Termination

     a.
This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License.
Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections
from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses
terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full
compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will
survive any termination of this License.

     b. Subject to the above
terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the
duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the
above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different
license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided,
however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License
(or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted
under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in
full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.

8.
Miscellaneous

     a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform
the Work or a Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a
license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license
granted to You under this License.

     b. Each time You Distribute
or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor offers to the recipient a
license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the
license granted to You under this License.

     c. If any provision
of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it
shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of
the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties
to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum
extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.

    
d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no
breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing
and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.

  
  e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties
with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings,
agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified
here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that
may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be
modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and
You.

     f. The rights granted under, and the subject matter
referenced, in this License were drafted utilizing the terminology of
the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works
(as amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the
WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms
Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on
July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter take effect in the
relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be
enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the
implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable national
law. If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable
copyright law includes additional rights not granted under this
License, such additional rights are deemed to be included in the
License; this License is not intended to restrict the license of any
rights under applicable law.

Creative Commons Corporation (“Creative Commons”) is not a law

Using Creative Commons Public
Licenses
 
Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of
terms and conditions that creators and other rights holders may use to
share original works of authorship and other material subject to
copyright and certain other rights specified in the public license
below. The following considerations are for informational purposes
only, are not exhaustive, and do not form part of our
licenses.

Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are
intended for use by those authorized to give the public permission to
use material in ways otherwise restricted by copyright and certain
other rights. Our licenses are irrevocable. Licensors should read and
understand the terms and conditions of the license they choose before
applying it. Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before
applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the material as
expected. Licensors should clearly mark any material not subject to
the license. This includes other CC-licensed material, or material
used under an exception or limitation to copyright. More
considerations for licensors.

Considerations for the public: By using
one of our public licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to
use the licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If the
licensor’s permission is not necessary for any reason–for example,
because of any applicable exception or limitation to copyright–then
that use is not regulated by the license. Our licenses grant only
permissions under copyright and certain other rights that a licensor
has authority to grant. Use of the licensed material may still be
restricted for other reasons, including because others have copyright
or other rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests,
such as asking that all changes be marked or described. Although not
required by our licenses, you are encouraged to respect those requests
where reasonable. More considerations for the public. 

Creative
Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International Public License

By
exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree
to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons
Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International Public License (""Public
License""). To the extent this Public License may be interpreted as a
contract, You are granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your
acceptance of these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You
such rights in consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from
making the Licensed Material available under these terms and
conditions.

Section 1 – Definitions.

     a.	Adapted Material
means material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights that is derived
from or based upon the Licensed Material and in which the Licensed
Material is translated, altered, arranged, transformed, or otherwise
modified in a manner requiring permission under the Copyright and
Similar Rights held by the Licensor. For purposes of this Public
License, where the Licensed Material is a musical work, performance,
or sound recording, Adapted Material is always produced where the
Licensed Material is synched in timed relation with a moving image.
	

    b.	Adapter's License means the license You apply to Your Copyright
and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in
accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License.
	
   
 c.	Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights
closely related to copyright including, without limitation,
performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database
Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or categorized.
For purposes of this Public License, the rights specified in Section
2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar Rights.
	
     d.	Effective
Technological Measures means those measures that, in the absence of
proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws fulfilling
obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright Treaty adopted on
December 20, 1996, and/or similar international agreements.
	
    
e.	Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or any
other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights that
applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.
	
     f.	Licensed
Material means the artistic or literary work, database, or other
material to which the Licensor applied this Public License.
	
    
g.	Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the
terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to all
Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed
Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.
	
    
h.	Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights
under this Public License.
	
     i.	NonCommercial means not primarily
intended for or directed towards commercial advantage or monetary
compensation. For purposes of this Public License, the exchange of the
Licensed Material for other material subject to Copyright and Similar
Rights by digital file-sharing or similar means is NonCommercial
provided there is no payment of monetary compensation in connection
with the exchange.
	
     j.	Share means to provide material to the
public by any means or process that requires permission under the
Licensed Rights, such as reproduction, public display, public
performance, distribution, dissemination, communication, or
importation, and to make material available to the public including in
ways that members of the public may access the material from a place
and at a time individually chosen by them.
	
     k.	Sui Generis
Database Rights means rights other than copyright resulting from
Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11
March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, as amended and/or
succeeded, as well as other essentially equivalent rights anywhere in
the world.
	
     l.	You means the individual or entity exercising the
Licensed Rights under this Public License. Your has a corresponding
meaning.

Section 2 – Scope.
	
     a.	License grant.
	
          1.
Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the
Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to exercise the
Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:

               A.
reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part, for
NonCommercial purposes only; and

               B. produce,
reproduce, and Share Adapted Material for NonCommercial purposes
only.
	
          2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of
doubt, where Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public
License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with its terms
and conditions.
	
          3. Term. The term of this Public License
is specified in Section 6(a).
	
          4. Media and formats;
technical modifications allowed. The Licensor authorizes You to
exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats whether now
known or hereafter created, and to make technical modifications
necessary to do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert
any right or authority to forbid You from making technical
modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including
technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective
Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License, simply
making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)(4) never produces
Adapted Material.
	
          5. Downstream recipients.

             
 A. Offer from the Licensor – Licensed Material. Every recipient of
the Licensed Material automatically receives an offer from the
Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights under the terms and
conditions of this Public License.
	
               B. No downstream
restrictions. You may not offer or impose any additional or different
terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures
to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the
Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed Material.
	
         
6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may
be construed as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that
Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected with, or sponsored,
endorsed, or granted official status by, the Licensor or others
designated to receive attribution as provided in Section
3(a)(1)(A)(i).
	
     b.	Other rights.
	
          1. Moral rights,
such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this Public
License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar personality
rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or
agrees not to assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the
limited extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights,
but not otherwise.

          2. Patent and trademark rights are not
licensed under this Public License.
	
          3. To the extent
possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect royalties from You
for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether directly or through a
collecting society under any voluntary or waivable statutory or
compulsory licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly
reserves any right to collect such royalties, including when the
Licensed Material is used other than for NonCommercial
purposes.

Section 3 – License Conditions.

Your exercise of the
Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the following
conditions.
	
     a.	Attribution.
	
          1. If You Share the
Licensed Material (including in modified form), You must:

           
   A. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor with the
Licensed Material:

                    i.	identification of the
creator(s) of the Licensed Material and any others designated to
receive attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by the
Licensor (including by pseudonym if designated);

                   
ii.	a copyright notice;

                    iii. a notice that refers
to this Public License;

                    iv.	a notice that refers
to the disclaimer of warranties;

                    v.	a URI or
hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the extent reasonably
practicable;
	
               B. indicate if You modified the Licensed
Material and retain an indication of any previous modifications; and


              C. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this
Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to,
this Public License.
	
          2. You may satisfy the conditions in
Section 3(a)(1) in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means,
and context in which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it
may be reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or
hyperlink to a resource that includes the required information.
	
    
     3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the
information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent reasonably
practicable.
	
          4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce,
the Adapter's License You apply must not prevent recipients of the
Adapted Material from complying with this Public License.

Section 4
– Sui Generis Database Rights.

Where the Licensed Rights include
Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed
Material:
	
     a.	for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants
You the right to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a
substantial portion of the contents of the database for NonCommercial
purposes only;
	
     b.	if You include all or a substantial portion
of the database contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis
Database Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis
Database Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material;
and
	
     c.	You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if
You Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the
database.
For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and
does not replace Your obligations under this Public License where the
Licensed Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.

Section 5
– Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.
	
    
a.	Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the
extent possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and
as-available, and makes no representations or warranties of any kind
concerning the Licensed Material, whether express, implied, statutory,
or other. This includes, without limitation, warranties of title,
merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement,
absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the presence or
absence of errors, whether or not known or discoverable. Where
disclaimers of warranties are not allowed in full or in part, this
disclaimer may not apply to You.
	
     b.	To the extent possible, in
no event will the Licensor be liable to You on any legal theory
(including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise for any
direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive,
exemplary, or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of
this Public License or use of the Licensed Material, even if the
Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such losses, costs,
expenses, or damages. Where a limitation of liability is not allowed
in full or in part, this limitation may not apply to You.
	
    
c.	The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided
above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible,
most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all
liability.

Section 6 – Term and Termination.
	
     a.	This Public
License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights
licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public
License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate
automatically.
	
     b.	Where Your right to use the Licensed Material
has terminated under Section 6(a), it reinstates:
	
          1.
automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is
cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or
	
        
 2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.
	
     c.	For the
avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the
Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public
License.
	
     d.	For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also
offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop
distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will
not terminate this Public License.
	
     e.	Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and
8 survive termination of this Public License.

Section 7 – Other
Terms and Conditions.
	
     a.	The Licensor shall not be bound by any
additional or different terms or conditions communicated by You unless
expressly agreed.
	
     b.	Any arrangements, understandings, or
agreements regarding the Licensed Material not stated herein are
separate from and independent of the terms and conditions of this
Public License.

Section 8 – Interpretation.
	
     a.	For the
avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not be
interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any
use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without
permission under this Public License.
	
     b.	To the extent
possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed
unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum
extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be

IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE
(""CCPL"" OR ""LICENSE""). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER
APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER
THIS LICENSE IS PROHIBITED.

BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK
PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS
LICENSE. THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN
CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.

1.
Definitions

     a. ""Collective Work"" means a work, such as a
periodical issue, anthology or encyclopedia, in which the Work in its
entirety in unmodified form, along with a number of other
contributions, constituting separate and independent works in
themselves, are assembled into a collective whole. A work that
constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work
(as defined below) for the purposes of this License.

     b.
""Derivative Work"" means a work based upon the Work or upon the Work
and other pre-existing works, such as a translation, musical
arrangement, dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture version,
sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment, condensation, or any
other form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted,
except that a work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be
considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License.

     c.
""Licensor"" means the individual or entity that offers the Work under
the terms of this License.

     d. ""Original Author"" means the
individual or entity who created the Work.

     e. ""Work"" means the
copyrightable work of authorship offered under the terms of this
License.

     f. ""You"" means an individual or entity exercising
rights under this License who has not previously violated the terms of
this License with respect to the Work, or who has received express
permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License
despite a previous violation.

2. Fair Use Rights. Nothing in this
license is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any rights arising
from fair use, first sale or other limitations on the exclusive rights
of the copyright owner under copyright law or other applicable
laws.

3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
License, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable
copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work as stated
below:

     a. to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into
one or more Collective Works, and to reproduce the Work as
incorporated in the Collective Works;

     b. to distribute copies or
phonorecords of, display publicly, perform publicly, and perform
publicly by means of a digital audio transmission the Work including
as incorporated in Collective Works;

The above rights may be
exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter
devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications
as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and
formats. All rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby
reserved.

4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is
expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:


    a. You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or
publicly digitally perform the Work only under the terms of this
License, and You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource
Identifier for, this License with every copy or phonorecord of the
Work You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly
digitally perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work
that alter or restrict the terms of this License or the recipients'
exercise of the rights granted hereunder. You may not sublicense the
Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and
to the disclaimer of warranties. You may not distribute, publicly
display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work with
any technological measures that control access or use of the Work in a
manner inconsistent with the terms of this License Agreement. The
above applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collective Work, but
this does not require the Collective Work apart from the Work itself
to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a
Collective Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent
practicable, remove from the Collective Work any reference to such
Licensor or the Original Author, as requested.

     b. You may not
exercise any of the rights granted to You in Section 3 above in any
manner that is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial
advantage or private monetary compensation. The exchange of the Work
for other copyrighted works by means of digital file-sharing or
otherwise shall not be considered to be intended for or directed
toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation, provided
there is no payment of any monetary compensation in connection with
the exchange of copyrighted works.

     c. If you distribute,
publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the
Work or any Collective Works, You must keep intact all copyright
notices for the Work and give the Original Author credit reasonable to
the medium or means You are utilizing by conveying the name (or
pseudonym if applicable) of the Original Author if supplied; the title
of the Work if supplied. Such credit may be implemented in any
reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Collective
Work, at a minimum such credit will appear where any other comparable
authorship credit appears and in a manner at least as prominent as
such other comparable authorship credit.

5. Representations,
Warranties and Disclaimer

     a. By offering the Work for public
release under this License, Licensor represents and warrants that, to
the best of Licensor's knowledge after reasonable inquiry:

         
i. Licensor has secured all rights in the Work necessary to grant the
license rights hereunder and to permit the lawful exercise of the
rights granted hereunder without You having any obligation to pay any
royalties, compulsory license fees, residuals or any other payments;


         ii. The Work does not infringe the copyright, trademark,
publicity rights, common law rights or any other right of any third
party or constitute defamation, invasion of privacy or other tortious
injury to any third party.

     b. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY STATED IN THIS
LICENSE OR OTHERWISE AGREED IN WRITING OR REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW,
THE WORK IS LICENSED ON AN ""AS IS"" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY
KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY
WARRANTIES REGARDING THE CONTENTS OR ACCURACY OF THE WORK.

6.
Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE
LAW, AND EXCEPT FOR DAMAGES ARISING FROM LIABILITY TO A THIRD PARTY
RESULTING FROM BREACH OF THE WARRANTIES IN SECTION 5, IN NO EVENT WILL
LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL,
INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT
OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN
ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. Termination

     a.
This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License.
Individuals or entities who have received Collective Works from You
under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated
provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with
those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any
termination of this License.

     b. Subject to the above terms and
conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of
the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above,
Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different
license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided,
however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License
(or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted
under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in
full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.

8.
Miscellaneous

     a. Each time You distribute or publicly digitally
perform the Work or a Collective Work, the Licensor offers to the
recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as
the license granted to You under this License.

     b. If any
provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable
law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the
remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by
the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the
minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and
enforceable.

     c. No term or provision of this License shall be
deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent
shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such
waiver or consent.

     d. This License constitutes the entire
agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here.
There are no understandings, agreements or representations with
respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by
any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from
You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written
agreement of the Licensor and You. 

Creative Commons is not a party
to this License, and makes no warranty whatsoever in connection with
the Work. Creative Commons will not be liable to You or any party on
any legal theory for any damages whatsoever, including without
limitation any general, special, incidental or consequential damages
arising in connection to this license. Notwithstanding the foregoing
two (2) sentences, if Creative Commons has expressly identified itself
as the Licensor hereunder, it shall have all rights and obligations of
Licensor.

Except for the limited purpose of indicating to the public
that the Work is licensed under the CCPL, neither party will use the
trademark ""Creative Commons"" or any related trademark or logo of
Creative Commons without the prior written consent of Creative
Commons. Any permitted use will be in compliance with Creative

except that a work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be
considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License. For the
avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical composition or sound

moving image (""synching"") will be considered a Derivative Work for the
purpose of this License.

     c. ""Licensor"" means the individual or

4. Restrictions.The license granted in Section 3 above is
expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:

     b. You may not
exercise any of the rights granted to You in Section 3 above in any
manner that is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial
advantage or private monetary compensation. The exchange of the Work
for other copyrighted works by means of digital file-sharing or
otherwise shall not be considered to be intended for or directed
toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation, provided
there is no payment of any monetary compensation in connection with
the exchange of copyrighted works.

     c. If you distribute,

Work, at a minimum such credit will appear where any other comparable
authorship credit appears and in a manner at least as prominent as
such other comparable authorship credit.

     d. For the avoidance of
doubt, where the Work is a musical composition:

          i.
Performancf Royalties Under Blanket Licenses. Licensor reserves the
exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a performance
rights society (e.g. ASCAP, BMI, SESAC), royalties for the public

commercial advantage or private monetary compensation.

          ii.
Mechanical Rights and Statutory Royalties. Licensor reserves the
exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a music rights
agency or designated agent (e.g. Harry Fox Agency), royalties for any
phonorecord You create from the Work (""cover version"") and distribute,

US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions), if Your
distribution of such cover version is primarily intended for or
directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary
compensation.

     e. Webcasting Rights and Statutory Royalties. For
the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a sound recording, Licensor
reserves the exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a
performance-rights society (e.g. SoundExchange), royalties for the
public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work, subject to the
compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 114 of the US Copyright
Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions), if Your public digital
performance is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial
advantage or private monetary compensation.

PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER
DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR

IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

     e. Webcasting Rights
and Statutory Royalties. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is
a sound recording, Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect,
whether individually or via a performance-rights society (e.g.
SoundExchange), royalties for the public digital performance (e.g.
webcast) of the Work, subject to the compulsory license created by 17
USC Section 114 of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other
jurisdictions), if Your public digital performance is primarily
intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private
monetary compensation.

5. Representations, Warranties and
Disclaimer

UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED BY THE PARTIES IN
WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS
OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED,
STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF
TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE,
NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY,
OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE.
SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES,
SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

6. Limitation on Liability.
EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL
LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL,
INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT
OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN
ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. Termination

     a.
This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License.
Individuals or entities who have received Collective Works from You
under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated
provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with
those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any
termination of this License.

     b. Subject to the above terms and
conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of
the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above,
Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different
license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided,
however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License
(or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted
under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in
full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.

8.
Miscellaneous

     a. Each time You distribute or publicly digitally
perform the Work or a Collective Work, the Licensor offers to the
recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as
the license granted to You under this License.

     b. If any
provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable
law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the
remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by
the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the
minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and
enforceable.

     c. No term or provision of this License shall be
deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent
shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such
waiver or consent.

     d. This License constitutes the entire
agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here.
There are no understandings, agreements or representations with
respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by
any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from
You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written
agreement of the Licensor and You. 

Creative Commons is not a party
to this License, and makes no warranty whatsoever in connection with

arising in connection to this license. Notwithstanding the foregoing
two (2) sentences, if Creative Commons has expressly identified itself
as the Licensor hereunder, it shall have all rights and obligations of
Licensor.

Except for the limited purpose of indicating to the public
that the Work is licensed under the CCPL, neither party will use the
trademark ""Creative Commons"" or any related trademark or logo of
Creative Commons without the prior written consent of Creative
Commons. Any permitted use will be in compliance with Creative

includes cinematographic adaptations or any other form in which the
Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted including in any form

broadcasts, or other works or subject matter other than works listed
in Section 1(f) below, which, by reason of the selection and
arrangement of their contents, constitute intellectual creations, in
which the Work is included in its entirety in unmodified form along
with one or more other contributions, each constituting separate and

collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collection will not be
considered an Adaptation (as defined above) for the purposes of this

the performances of the Work, including by public digital performance;
to broadcast and rebroadcast the Work by any means including signs,
sounds or images.

     i. ""Reproduce"" means to make copies of the
Work by any means including without limitation by sound or visual
recordings and the right of fixation and reproducing fixations of the

2. Fair Dealing Rights.
Nothing in this License is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any
uses free from copyright or rights arising from limitations or
exceptions that are provided for in connection with the copyright
protection under copyright law or other applicable laws.

3. License
Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor
hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual
(for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the
rights in the Work as stated below:

     a. to Reproduce the Work, to
incorporate the Work into one or more Collections, and to Reproduce
the Work as incorporated in the Collections; and,

     b. to
Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated in
Collections.

The above rights may be exercised in all media and
formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above rights
include the right to make such modifications as are technically
necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats, but
otherwise you have no rights to make Adaptations. Subject to 8(f), all
rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved,
including but not limited to the rights set forth in Section 4(d).

4.
Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made
subject to and limited by the following restrictions:

     a. You may
Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of this
License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource
Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You
Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms
on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of
the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that
recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the
Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and
to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You
Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly
Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological
measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the
Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under
the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as
incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection
apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this
License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You
must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit
as required by Section 4(c), as requested.

     b. You may not
exercise any of the rights granted to You in Section 3 above in any
manner that is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial
advantage or private monetary compensation. The exchange of the Work
for other copyrighted works by means of digital file-sharing or
otherwise shall not be considered to be intended for or directed
toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation, provided
there is no payment of any monetary compensation in connection with
the exchange of copyrighted works.

     c. If You Distribute, or
Publicly Perform the Work or Collections, You must, unless a request
has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright
notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means
You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym,
if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or
Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor
institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution (""Attribution
Parties"") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other
reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of
the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the
URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work,
unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing
information for the Work. The credit required by this Section 4(c) may
be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in
the case of a Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a
credit for all contributing authors of Collection appears, then as
part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the
credits for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of
doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section for the
purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising
Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly
assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the
Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate,
of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express prior
written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution
Parties.

     d. For the avoidance of doubt:

          i.
Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in
which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or
compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves
the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You
of the rights granted under this License;

          ii. Waivable
Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right
to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing
scheme can be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to
collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted
under this License if Your exercise of such rights is for a purpose or
use which is otherwise than noncommercial as permitted under Section
4(b) and otherwise waives the right to collect royalties through any
statutory or compulsory licensing scheme; and,

          iii.
Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor reserves the right to collect
royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is
a member of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing
schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the rights
granted under this License that is for a purpose or use which is
otherwise than noncommercial as permitted under Section 4(b).

     e.
Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be
otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or
Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any
Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other
derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial
to the Original Author's honor or reputation.

5. Representations,
Warranties and Disclaimer

UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED BY THE
PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO
REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK,
EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER
DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR
NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF
IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

6.
Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE
LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY
FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY
DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF
LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7.
Termination

     a. This License and the rights granted hereunder
will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of
this License. Individuals or entities who have received Collections
from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses
terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full
compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will
survive any termination of this License.

     b. Subject to the above
terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the
duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the
above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different
license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided,
however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License
(or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted
under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in
full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.

8.
Miscellaneous

     a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform
the Work or a Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a
license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license
granted to You under this License.

     b. If any provision of this
License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not
affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of
this License, and without further action by the parties to this
agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent
necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.

     c. No
term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach
consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and
signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.

    
d. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties
with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings,
agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified
here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that
may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be
modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and
You.

     e. The rights granted under, and the subject matter
referenced, in this License were drafted utilizing the terminology of
the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works
(as amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the
WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms
Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on
July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter take effect in the
relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be
enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the
implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable national
law. If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable
copyright law includes additional rights not granted under this
License, such additional rights are deemed to be included in the
License; this License is not intended to restrict the license of any
rights under applicable law.

  Creative Commons Corporation (“Creative Commons”)

Distribution of Creative Commons public licenses does not create a
lawyer-client or other relationship. Creative Commons makes its
licenses and related information available on an “as-is” basis.

Using
Creative Commons Public Licenses

Creative Commons public licenses
provide a standard set of terms and conditions that creators and other
rights holders may use to share original works of authorship and other
material subject to copyright and certain other rights specified in
the public license below. The following considerations are for
informational purposes only, are not exhaustive, and do not form part
of our licenses.

Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses
are intended for use by those authorized to give the public permission
to use material in ways otherwise restricted by copyright and certain
other rights. Our licenses are irrevocable. Licensors should read and
understand the terms and conditions of the license they choose before
applying it. Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before
applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the material as
expected. Licensors should clearly mark any material not subject to
the license. This includes other CC-licensed material, or material
used under an exception or limitation to copyright. More
considerations for licensors.

Considerations for the public: By using
one of our public licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to
use the licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If the
licensor’s permission is not necessary for any reason–for example,
because of any applicable exception or limitation to copyright–then
that use is not regulated by the license. Our licenses grant only
permissions under copyright and certain other rights that a licensor
has authority to grant. Use of the licensed material may still be
restricted for other reasons, including because others have copyright
or other rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests,
such as asking that all changes be marked or described. Although not
required by our licenses, you are encouraged to respect those requests
where reasonable. More considerations for the public.

By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You
accept and agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this
Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0
International Public License (""Public License""). To the extent this
Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are granted the
Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of these terms and

of benefits the Licensor receives from making the Licensed Material
available under these terms and conditions.

Section 1 –
Definitions.

Copyright and Similar Rights that is derived from or based upon the
Licensed Material and in which the Licensed Material is translated,
altered, arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner
requiring permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by

Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording, Adapted
Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is synched in
timed relation with a moving image.
	
     b.	Copyright and Similar
Rights means copyright and/or similar rights closely related to
copyright including, without limitation, performance, broadcast, sound
recording, and Sui Generis Database Rights, without regard to how the
rights are labeled or categorized. For purposes of this Public
License, the rights specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright
and Similar Rights.
	
     c.	Effective Technological Measures means
those measures that, in the absence of proper authority, may not be
circumvented under laws fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the
WIPO Copyright Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar
international agreements.
	
     d.	Exceptions and Limitations means
fair use, fair dealing, and/or any other exception or limitation to
Copyright and Similar Rights that applies to Your use of the Licensed
Material.
	
     e.	Licensed Material means the artistic or literary
work, database, or other material to which the Licensor applied this
Public License.
	
     f.	Licensed Rights means the rights granted to
You subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, which
are limited to all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use
of the Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to
license.
	
     g.	Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies)
granting rights under this Public License.
	
     h.	NonCommercial
means not primarily intended for or directed towards commercial
advantage or monetary compensation. For purposes of this Public
License, the exchange of the Licensed Material for other material
subject to Copyright and Similar Rights by digital file-sharing or
similar means is NonCommercial provided there is no payment of
monetary compensation in connection with the exchange.
	
     i.	Share
means to provide material to the public by any means or process that
requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such as reproduction,
public display, public performance, distribution, dissemination,
communication, or importation, and to make material available to the
public including in ways that members of the public may access the
material from a place and at a time individually chosen by them.
	
   
 j.	Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright
resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the
Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, as
amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially equivalent
rights anywhere in the world.
	
     k.	You means the individual or
entity exercising the Licensed Rights under this Public License. Your
has a corresponding meaning.

Section 2 – Scope.
	
     a.	License
grant.
	
          1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Public License, the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide,
royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to
exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:

           
   A. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part,
for NonCommercial purposes only; and

               B. produce and
reproduce, but not Share, Adapted Material for NonCommercial purposes
only.
	
          2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of
doubt, where Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public
License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with its terms
and conditions.
	
          3. Term. The term of this Public License
is specified in Section 6(a).
	
          4. Media and formats;
technical modifications allowed. The Licensor authorizes You to
exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats whether now
known or hereafter created, and to make technical modifications
necessary to do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert
any right or authority to forbid You from making technical
modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including
technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective
Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License, simply
making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)(4) never produces
Adapted Material.
	
          5. Downstream recipients.
              
A. Offer from the Licensor – Licensed Material. Every recipient of
the Licensed Material automatically receives an offer from the
Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights under the terms and
conditions of this Public License.
	
               B. No downstream
restrictions. You may not offer or impose any additional or different
terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures
to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the
Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed Material.
	
         
6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may
be construed as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that
Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected with, or sponsored,
endorsed, or granted official status by, the Licensor or others
designated to receive attribution as provided in Section
3(a)(1)(A)(i).
	
     b.	Other rights.
	
          1. Moral rights,
such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this Public
License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar personality
rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or
agrees not to assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the
limited extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights,
but not otherwise.
	
          2. Patent and trademark rights are not
licensed under this Public License.
	
          3. To the extent
possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect royalties from You
for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether directly or through a
collecting society under any voluntary or waivable statutory or
compulsory licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly
reserves any right to collect such royalties, including when the
Licensed Material is used other than for NonCommercial
purposes.

Section 3 – License Conditions.

Your exercise of the
Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the following
conditions.

     a.	Attribution.
	
          1. If You Share the
Licensed Material, You must:

               A. retain the following
if it is supplied by the Licensor with the Licensed Material:

       
            i.	identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed
Material and any others designated to receive attribution, in any
reasonable manner requested by the Licensor (including by pseudonym if
designated);

                    ii.	a copyright notice;

           
        iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;

           
        iv.	a notice that refers to the disclaimer of warranties;

   
                v.	a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the
extent reasonably practicable;
	
               B. indicate if You
modified the Licensed Material and retain an indication of any
previous modifications; and

               C. indicate the Licensed
Material is licensed under this Public License, and include the text
of, or the URI or hyperlink to, this Public License.
	
          2.
For the avoidance of doubt, You do not have permission under this
Public License to Share Adapted Material.
	
          3. You may
satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any reasonable manner
based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share the
Licensed Material. For example, it may be reasonable to satisfy the
conditions by providing a URI or hyperlink to a resource that includes
the required information.
	
          4. If requested by the Licensor,
You must remove any of the information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A)
to the extent reasonably practicable.

Section 4 – Sui Generis
Database Rights.

Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis
Database Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:

    
a.	for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to
extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of
the contents of the database for NonCommercial purposes only and
provided You do not Share Adapted Material;
	
     b.	if You include
all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a database in
which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in which
You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents)
is Adapted Material; and
	
     c.	You must comply with the conditions
in Section 3(a) if You Share all or a substantial portion of the
contents of the database.
For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4
supplements and does not replace Your obligations under this Public
License where the Licensed Rights include other Copyright and Similar
Rights.

Section 5 – Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of
Liability.
	
     a.	Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the
Licensor, to the extent possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed
Material as-is and as-available, and makes no representations or
warranties of any kind concerning the Licensed Material, whether
express, implied, statutory, or other. This includes, without
limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a
particular purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other
defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence of errors, whether or
not known or discoverable. Where disclaimers of warranties are not
allowed in full or in part, this disclaimer may not apply to You.
	
  
  b.	To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable
to You on any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence)
or otherwise for any direct, special, indirect, incidental,
consequential, punitive, exemplary, or other losses, costs, expenses,
or damages arising out of this Public License or use of the Licensed
Material, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of
such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where a limitation of
liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not
apply to You.
	
     c.	The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of
liability provided above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the
extent possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and
waiver of all liability.

Section 6 – Term and Termination.
	
    
a.	This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and
Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this
Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate
automatically.
	
     b.	Where Your right to use the Licensed Material
has terminated under Section 6(a), it reinstates:
	
          1.
automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is
cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or
	
        
 2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.
	
     c.	For the
avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the
Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public
License.
	
     d.	For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also
offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop
distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will
not terminate this Public License.
	
     e.	Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and
8 survive termination of this Public License.

Section 7 – Other
Terms and Conditions.
	
     a.	The Licensor shall not be bound by any
additional or different terms or conditions communicated by You unless
expressly agreed.
	
     b.	Any arrangements, understandings, or
agreements regarding the Licensed Material not stated herein are
separate from and independent of the terms and conditions of this
Public License.

Section 8 – Interpretation.
	
     a.	For the
avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not be
interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any
use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without
permission under this Public License.
	
     b.	To the extent
possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed
unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum
extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be
reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License without
affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions.
	

    c.	No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and
no failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the
Licensor.
	
     d.	Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may
be interpreted as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and
immunities that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal
processes of any jurisdiction or authority.

License

THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW)
IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE
(""CCPL"" OR ""LICENSE""). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER
APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER
THIS LICENSE IS PROHIBITED.

BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK
PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS
LICENSE. THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN
CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.

1.
Definitions

     a. ""Collective Work"" means a work, such as a
periodical issue, anthology or encyclopedia, in which the Work in its
entirety in unmodified form, along with a number of other
contributions, constituting separate and independent works in
themselves, are assembled into a collective whole. A work that
constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work
(as defined below) for the purposes of this License.

     b.
""Derivative Work"" means a work based upon the Work or upon the Work
and other pre-existing works, such as a translation, musical
arrangement, dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture version,
sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment, condensation, or any
other form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted,
except that a work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be
considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License.

     c.
""Licensor"" means the individual or entity that offers the Work under
the terms of this License.

     d. ""Original Author"" means the
individual or entity who created the Work.

     e. ""Work"" means the
copyrightable work of authorship offered under the terms of this
License.

     f. ""You"" means an individual or entity exercising
rights under this License who has not previously violated the terms of
this License with respect to the Work, or who has received express
permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License
despite a previous violation.

2. Fair Use Rights. Nothing in this
license is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any rights arising
from fair use, first sale or other limitations on the exclusive rights
of the copyright owner under copyright law or other applicable
laws.

3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
License, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable
copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work as stated
below:

     a. to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into
one or more Collective Works, and to reproduce the Work as
incorporated in the Collective Works;

     b. to create and reproduce
Derivative Works;

     c. to distribute copies or phonorecords of,
display publicly, perform publicly, and perform publicly by means of a
digital audio transmission the Work including as incorporated in
Collective Works;

     d. to distribute copies or phonorecords of,
display publicly, perform publicly, and perform publicly by means of a
digital audio transmission Derivative Works;

The above rights may be
exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter
devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications
as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and
formats. All rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby
reserved.

4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is
expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:


    a. You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or
publicly digitally perform the Work only under the terms of this
License, and You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource
Identifier for, this License with every copy or phonorecord of the
Work You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly
digitally perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work
that alter or restrict the terms of this License or the recipients'
exercise of the rights granted hereunder. You may not sublicense the
Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and
to the disclaimer of warranties. You may not distribute, publicly
display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work with
any technological measures that control access or use of the Work in a
manner inconsistent with the terms of this License Agreement. The
above applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collective Work, but
this does not require the Collective Work apart from the Work itself
to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a
Collective Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent
practicable, remove from the Collective Work any reference to such
Licensor or the Original Author, as requested. If You create a
Derivative Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent
practicable, remove from the Derivative Work any reference to such
Licensor or the Original Author, as requested.

     b. You may
distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally
perform a Derivative Work only under the terms of this License, and
You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for,
this License with every copy or phonorecord of each Derivative Work
You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly
digitally perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the
Derivative Works that alter or restrict the terms of this License or
the recipients' exercise of the rights granted hereunder, and You must
keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the
disclaimer of warranties. You may not distribute, publicly display,
publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Derivative Work
with any technological measures that control access or use of the Work
in a manner inconsistent with the terms of this License Agreement. The
above applies to the Derivative Work as incorporated in a Collective
Work, but this does not require the Collective Work apart from the
Derivative Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this
License.

     c. You may not exercise any of the rights granted to
You in Section 3 above in any manner that is primarily intended for or
directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation.
The exchange of the Work for other copyrighted works by means of
digital file-sharing or otherwise shall not be considered to be
intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private
monetary compensation, provided there is no payment of any monetary
compensation in connection with the exchange of copyrighted works.

  
  d. If you distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or
publicly digitally perform the Work or any Derivative Works or
Collective Works, You must keep intact all copyright notices for the
Work and give the Original Author credit reasonable to the medium or
means You are utilizing by conveying the name (or pseudonym if
applicable) of the Original Author if supplied; the title of the Work
if supplied; in the case of a Derivative Work, a credit identifying
the use of the Work in the Derivative Work (e.g., ""French translation
of the Work by Original Author,"" or ""Screenplay based on original Work
by Original Author""). Such credit may be implemented in any reasonable
manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Derivative Work or
Collective Work, at a minimum such credit will appear where any other
comparable authorship credit appears and in a manner at least as
prominent as such other comparable authorship credit.

5.
Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer

     a. By offering the
Work for public release under this License, Licensor represents and
warrants that, to the best of Licensor's knowledge after reasonable
inquiry:

          i. Licensor has secured all rights in the Work
necessary to grant the license rights hereunder and to permit the
lawful exercise of the rights granted hereunder without You having any
obligation to pay any royalties, compulsory license fees, residuals or
any other payments;

          ii. The Work does not infringe the
copyright, trademark, publicity rights, common law rights or any other
right of any third party or constitute defamation, invasion of privacy
or other tortious injury to any third party.

     b. EXCEPT AS
EXPRESSLY STATED IN THIS LICENSE OR OTHERWISE AGREED IN WRITING OR
REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE WORK IS LICENSED ON AN ""AS IS"" BASIS,
WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING,
WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES REGARDING THE CONTENTS OR ACCURACY
OF THE WORK.

6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT
REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, AND EXCEPT FOR DAMAGES ARISING FROM
LIABILITY TO A THIRD PARTY RESULTING FROM BREACH OF THE WARRANTIES IN
SECTION 5, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL
THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK,
EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES.

7. Termination

     a. This License and the rights granted
hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the
terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received
Derivative Works or Collective Works from You under this License,
however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such
individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses.
Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this
License.

     b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the
license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable
copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves
the right to release the Work under different license terms or to stop
distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such
election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license
that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this
License), and this License will continue in full force and effect
unless terminated as stated above.

8. Miscellaneous

     a. Each
time You distribute or publicly digitally perform the Work or a
Collective Work, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the
Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You
under this License.

     b. Each time You distribute or publicly
digitally perform a Derivative Work, Licensor offers to the recipient
a license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the
license granted to You under this License.

     c. If any provision
of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it
shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of
the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties
to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum
extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.

    
d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no
breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing
and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.

  
  e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties
with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings,
agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified
here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that
may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be
modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.


Creative Commons is not a party to this License, and makes no
warranty whatsoever in connection with the Work. Creative Commons will
not be liable to You or any party on any legal theory for any damages
whatsoever, including without limitation any general, special,
incidental or consequential damages arising in connection to this
license. Notwithstanding the foregoing two (2) sentences, if Creative
Commons has expressly identified itself as the Licensor hereunder, it
shall have all rights and obligations of Licensor.

Except for the
limited purpose of indicating to the public that the Work is licensed
under the CCPL, neither party will use the trademark ""Creative
Commons"" or any related trademark or logo of Creative Commons without
the prior written consent of Creative Commons. Any permitted use will
be in compliance with Creative Commons' then-current trademark usage
guidelines, as may be published on its website or otherwise made

APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER
THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.

BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS
TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE
TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED
HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND
CONDITIONS.

1. Definitions

     a. ""Collective Work"" means a work,
such as a periodical issue, anthology or encyclopedia, in which the
Work in its entirety in unmodified form, along with a number of other

and other pre-existing works, such as a translation, musical
arrangement, dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture version,

except that a work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be
considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License. For the
avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical composition or sound
recording, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a
moving image (""synching"") will be considered a Derivative Work for the
purpose of this License.

     c. ""Licensor"" means the individual or
entity that offers the Work under the terms of this License.

     d.
""Original Author"" means the individual or entity who created the
Work.

g. ""License Elements"" means the following high-level license
attributes as selected by Licensor and indicated in the title of this
License: Attribution, Noncommercial, ShareAlike.

2. Fair Use Rights.
Nothing in this license is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any
rights arising from fair use, first sale or other limitations on the
exclusive rights of the copyright owner under copyright law or other
applicable laws.

3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and
conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide,
royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the
applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work as
stated below:

     a. to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work
into one or more Collective Works, and to reproduce the Work as
incorporated in the Collective Works;

     b. to create and reproduce
Derivative Works;

     c. to distribute copies or phonorecords of,
display publicly, perform publicly, and perform publicly by means of a
digital audio transmission the Work including as incorporated in
Collective Works;

     d. to distribute copies or phonorecords of,
display publicly, perform publicly, and perform publicly by means of a
digital audio transmission Derivative Works;

The above rights may be
exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter
devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications
as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and
formats. All rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby
reserved, including but not limited to the rights set forth in
Sections 4(e) and 4(f).

4. Restrictions. The license granted in
Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the
following restrictions:

     a. You may distribute, publicly display,
publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work only under
the terms of this License, and You must include a copy of, or the
Uniform Resource Identifier for, this License with every copy or
phonorecord of the Work You distribute, publicly display, publicly
perform, or publicly digitally perform. You may not offer or impose
any terms on the Work that alter or restrict the terms of this License
or the recipients' exercise of the rights granted hereunder. You may
not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer
to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties. You may not
distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally
perform the Work with any technological measures that control access
or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with the terms of this
License Agreement. The above applies to the Work as incorporated in a
Collective Work, but this does not require the Collective Work apart
from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License.
If You create a Collective Work, upon notice from any Licensor You
must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collective Work any
reference to such Licensor or the Original Author, as requested. If
You create a Derivative Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must,
to the extent practicable, remove from the Derivative Work any
reference to such Licensor or the Original Author, as requested.

    
b. You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly
digitally perform a Derivative Work only under the terms of this
License, a later version of this License with the same License
Elements as this License, or a Creative Commons iCommons license that
contains the same License Elements as this License (e.g.
Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 2.0 Japan). You must include a
copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this License or other
license specified in the previous sentence with every copy or
phonorecord of each Derivative Work You distribute, publicly display,
publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform. You may not offer or
impose any terms on the Derivative Works that alter or restrict the
terms of this License or the recipients' exercise of the rights
granted hereunder, and You must keep intact all notices that refer to
this License and to the disclaimer of warranties. You may not
distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally
perform the Derivative Work with any technological measures that
control access or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with the
terms of this License Agreement. The above applies to the Derivative
Work as incorporated in a Collective Work, but this does not require
the Collective Work apart from the Derivative Work itself to be made
subject to the terms of this License.

     c. You may not exercise
any of the rights granted to You in Section 3 above in any manner that
is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or
private monetary compensation. The exchange of the Work for other
copyrighted works by means of digital file-sharing or otherwise shall
not be considered to be intended for or directed toward commercial
advantage or private monetary compensation, provided there is no
payment of any monetary compensation in connection with the exchange
of copyrighted works.

     d. If you distribute, publicly display,
publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work or any
Derivative Works or Collective Works, You must keep intact all
copyright notices for the Work and give the Original Author credit
reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing by conveying the
name (or pseudonym if applicable) of the Original Author if supplied;
the title of the Work if supplied; to the extent reasonably
practicable, the Uniform Resource Identifier, if any, that Licensor
specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not
refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work;
and in the case of a Derivative Work, a credit identifying the use of
the Work in the Derivative Work (e.g., ""French translation of the Work
by Original Author,"" or ""Screenplay based on original Work by Original
Author""). Such credit may be implemented in any reasonable manner;
provided, however, that in the case of a Derivative Work or Collective
Work, at a minimum such credit will appear where any other comparable
authorship credit appears and in a manner at least as prominent as
such other comparable authorship credit.

     e. For the avoidance of
doubt, where the Work is a musical composition:

          i.
Performance Royalties Under Blanket Licenses. Licensor reserves the
exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a performance
rights society (e.g. ASCAP, BMI, SESAC), royalties for the public
performance or public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work
if that performance is primarily intended for or directed toward
commercial advantage or private monetary compensation.

          ii.
Mechanical Rights and Statutory Royalties. Licensor reserves the
exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a music rights
agency or designated agent (e.g. Harry Fox Agency), royalties for any
phonorecord You create from the Work (""cover version"") and distribute,
subject to the compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 115 of the
US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions), if Your
distribution of such cover version is primarily intended for or
directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary
compensation.

     f. Webcasting Rights and Statutory Royalties. For
the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a sound recording, Licensor
reserves the exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a
performance-rights society (e.g. SoundExchange), royalties for the
public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work, subject to the
compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 114 of the US Copyright
Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions), if Your public digital
performance is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial
advantage or private monetary compensation.

5. Representations,
Warranties and Disclaimer

UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE
PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO
REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK,
EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER
DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR
NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF
IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

6.
Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE
LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY
FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY
DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF
LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7.
Termination

     a. This License and the rights granted hereunder
will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of
this License. Individuals or entities who have received Derivative
Works or Collective Works from You under this License, however, will
not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or
entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2,
5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.

perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work).
Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the
Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at
any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to

required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this
License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as
stated above.

License

THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW)
IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE
(""CCPL"" OR ""LICENSE""). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER
APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER
THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.

BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS
TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE
TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED
HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND
CONDITIONS.

1. Definitions

     a. ""Collective Work"" means a work,
such as a periodical issue, anthology or encyclopedia, in which the
Work in its entirety in unmodified form, along with a number of other
contributions, constituting separate and independent works in
themselves, are assembled into a collective whole. A work that
constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work
(as defined below) for the purposes of this License.

     b.
""Derivative Work"" means a work based upon the Work or upon the Work
and other pre-existing works, such as a translation, musical
arrangement, dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture version,
sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment, condensation, or any
other form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted,
except that a work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be
considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License. For the
avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical composition or sound
recording, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a
moving image (""synching"") will be considered a Derivative Work for the
purpose of this License.

     c. ""Licensor"" means the individual or
entity that offers the Work under the terms of this License.

     d.
""Original Author"" means the individual or entity who created the
Work.

     e. ""Work"" means the copyrightable work of authorship
offered under the terms of this License.

     f. ""You"" means an
individual or entity exercising rights under this License who has not
previously violated the terms of this License with respect to the
Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to
exercise rights under this License despite a previous violation.

    
g. ""License Elements"" means the following high-level license
attributes as selected by Licensor and indicated in the title of this
License: Attribution, Noncommercial, ShareAlike.

2. Fair Use Rights.
Nothing in this license is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any
rights arising from fair use, first sale or other limitations on the
exclusive rights of the copyright owner under copyright law or other
applicable laws.

3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and
conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide,
royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the
applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work as
stated below:

     a. to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work
into one or more Collective Works, and to reproduce the Work as
incorporated in the Collective Works;

     b. to create and reproduce
Derivative Works;

     c. to distribute copies or phonorecords of,
display publicly, perform publicly, and perform publicly by means of a
digital audio transmission the Work including as incorporated in
Collective Works;

     d. to distribute copies or phonorecords of,
display publicly, perform publicly, and perform publicly by means of a
digital audio transmission Derivative Works;

The above rights may be
exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter
devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications
as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and
formats. All rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby
reserved, including but not limited to the rights set forth in
Sections 4(e) and 4(f).

4. Restrictions. The license granted in
Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the
following restrictions:

     a. You may distribute, publicly display,
publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work only under
the terms of this License, and You must include a copy of, or the
Uniform Resource Identifier for, this License with every copy or
phonorecord of the Work You distribute, publicly display, publicly
perform, or publicly digitally perform. You may not offer or impose
any terms on the Work that alter or restrict the terms of this License
or the recipients' exercise of the rights granted hereunder. You may
not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer
to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties. You may not
distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally
perform the Work with any technological measures that control access
or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with the terms of this
License Agreement. The above applies to the Work as incorporated in a
Collective Work, but this does not require the Collective Work apart
from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License.
If You create a Collective Work, upon notice from any Licensor You
must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collective Work any
credit as required by clause 4(d), as requested. If You create a
Derivative Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent
practicable, remove from the Derivative Work any credit as required by
clause 4(d), as requested.

     b. You may distribute, publicly
display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform a Derivative
Work only under the terms of this License, a later version of this
License with the same License Elements as this License, or a Creative
Commons iCommons license that contains the same License Elements as
this License (e.g. Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 2.5 Japan).
You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for,
this License or other license specified in the previous sentence with
every copy or phonorecord of each Derivative Work You distribute,
publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform. You
may not offer or impose any terms on the Derivative Works that alter
or restrict the terms of this License or the recipients' exercise of
the rights granted hereunder, and You must keep intact all notices
that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties. You
may not distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly
digitally perform the Derivative Work with any technological measures
that control access or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with
the terms of this License Agreement. The above applies to the
Derivative Work as incorporated in a Collective Work, but this does
not require the Collective Work apart from the Derivative Work itself
to be made subject to the terms of this License.

     c. You may not
exercise any of the rights granted to You in Section 3 above in any
manner that is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial
advantage or private monetary compensation. The exchange of the Work
for other copyrighted works by means of digital file-sharing or
otherwise shall not be considered to be intended for or directed
toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation, provided
there is no payment of any monetary compensation in connection with
the exchange of copyrighted works.

     d. If you distribute,
publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the
Work or any Derivative Works or Collective Works, You must keep intact
all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the
medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author
(or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or (ii) if the Original
Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g. a
sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution in
Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable
means, the name of such party or parties; the title of the Work if
supplied; to the extent reasonably practicable, the Uniform Resource
Identifier, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the
Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or
licensing information for the Work; and in the case of a Derivative
Work, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Derivative Work
(e.g., ""French translation of the Work by Original Author,"" or
""Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author""). Such credit
may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that
in the case of a Derivative Work or Collective Work, at a minimum such
credit will appear where any other comparable authorship credit
appears and in a manner at least as prominent as such other comparable
authorship credit.

     e. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work
is a musical composition:

          i. Performance Royalties Under
Blanket Licenses. Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect,
whether individually or via a performance rights society (e.g. ASCAP,
BMI, SESAC), royalties for the public performance or public digital
performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work if that performance is
primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or
private monetary compensation.

          ii. Mechanical Rights and
Statutory Royalties. Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect,
whether individually or via a music rights agency or designated agent
(e.g. Harry Fox Agency), royalties for any phonorecord You create from
the Work (""cover version"") and distribute, subject to the compulsory
license created by 17 USC Section 115 of the US Copyright Act (or the
equivalent in other jurisdictions), if Your distribution of such cover
version is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial
advantage or private monetary compensation.

     f. Webcasting Rights
and Statutory Royalties. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is
a sound recording, Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect,
whether individually or via a performance-rights society (e.g.
SoundExchange), royalties for the public digital performance (e.g.
webcast) of the Work, subject to the compulsory license created by 17
USC Section 114 of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other
jurisdictions), if Your public digital performance is primarily
intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private
monetary compensation.

5. Representations, Warranties and
Disclaimer

UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN
WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS
OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED,
STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF
TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE,
NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY,
OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE.
SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES,
SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

6. Limitation on Liability.
EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL
LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL,
INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT
OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN
ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. Termination

     a.
This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License.
Individuals or entities who have received Derivative Works or
Collective Works from You under this License, however, will not have
their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain
in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8
will survive any termination of this License.

     b. Subject to the
above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for
the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding
the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under
different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time;
provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw
this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to
be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will
continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated
above.

8. Miscellaneous

     a. Each time You distribute or publicly
digitally perform the Work or a Collective Work, the Licensor offers
to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and
conditions as the license granted to You under this License.

     b.
Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform a Derivative
Work, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work
on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under
this License.

     c. If any provision of this License is invalid or
unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity
or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and
without further action by the parties to this agreement, such
provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make
such provision valid and enforceable.

     d. No term or provision of
this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless
such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to
be charged with such waiver or consent.

     e. This License
constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to
the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or
representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor
shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any
communication from You. This License may not be modified without the
mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You. 

Creative Commons

and obligations of Licensor.

includes cinematographic adaptations or any other form in which the
Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted including in any form
recognizably derived from the original, except that a work that
constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation for the

3. License
Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor
hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual
(for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the
rights in the Work as stated below:

     a. to Reproduce the Work, to
incorporate the Work into one or more Collections, and to Reproduce
the Work as incorporated in the Collections;

     b. to create and
Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such Adaptation, including any
translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps to clearly label,
demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made to the original
Work. For example, a translation could be marked ""The original work
was translated from English to Spanish,"" or a modification could
indicate ""The original work has been modified."";

     c. to
Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated in
Collections; and,

     d. to Distribute and Publicly Perform
Adaptations.

The above rights may be exercised in all media and
formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above rights
include the right to make such modifications as are technically
necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats. Subject
to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly granted by Licensor are
hereby reserved, including but not limited to the rights described in
Section 4(e).

4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above
is expressly made subject to and limited by the following
restrictions:

     a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work
only under the terms of this License. You must include a copy of, or
the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every
copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer
or impose any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this
License or the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the
rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. You
may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that
refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every
copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You
Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any
effective technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability
of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to
that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a)
applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not
require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made subject
to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection, upon notice
from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the
Collection any credit as required by Section 4(d), as requested. If
You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to
the extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as
required by Section 4(d), as requested.

     b. You may Distribute or
Publicly Perform an Adaptation only under: (i) the terms of this
License; (ii) a later version of this License with the same License
Elements as this License; (iii) a Creative Commons jurisdiction
license (either this or a later license version) that contains the
same License Elements as this License (e.g.,
Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 US) (""Applicable License"").
You must include a copy of, or the URI, for Applicable License with
every copy of each Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You
may not offer or impose any terms on the Adaptation that restrict the
terms of the Applicable License or the ability of the recipient of the
Adaptation to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the
terms of the Applicable License. You must keep intact all notices that
refer to the Applicable License and to the disclaimer of warranties
with every copy of the Work as included in the Adaptation You
Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly
Perform the Adaptation, You may not impose any effective technological
measures on the Adaptation that restrict the ability of a recipient of
the Adaptation from You to exercise the rights granted to that
recipient under the terms of the Applicable License. This Section 4(b)
applies to the Adaptation as incorporated in a Collection, but this
does not require the Collection apart from the Adaptation itself to be
made subject to the terms of the Applicable License.

     c. You may
not exercise any of the rights granted to You in Section 3 above in
any manner that is primarily intended for or directed toward
commercial advantage or private monetary compensation. The exchange of
the Work for other copyrighted works by means of digital file-sharing
or otherwise shall not be considered to be intended for or directed
toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation, provided
there is no payment of any monetary compensation in con-nection with
the exchange of copyrighted works.

     d. If You Distribute, or
Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or Collections, You must,
unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact
all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the
medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author
(or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original
Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a
sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution
(""Attribution Parties"") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of
service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or
parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent
reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be
associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the
copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and, (iv)
consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a credit
identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., ""French
translation of the Work by Original Author,"" or ""Screenplay based on
original Work by Original Author""). The credit required by this
Section 4(d) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided,
however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum
such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of
the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these credits
and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other
contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the
credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the
manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this
License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any
connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author,
Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your
use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written
permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution
Parties.

     e. For the avoidance of doubt:

          i.
Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in
which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or
compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves
the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You
of the rights granted under this License;

          ii. Waivable
Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right
to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing
scheme can be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to
collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted
under this License if Your exercise of such rights is for a purpose or
use which is otherwise than noncommercial as permitted under Section
4(c) and otherwise waives the right to collect royalties through any
statutory or compulsory licensing scheme; and,

          iii.
Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor reserves the right to collect
royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is
a member of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing
schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the rights
granted under this License that is for a purpose or use which is
otherwise than noncommercial as permitted under Section 4(c).

     f.
Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be
otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or
Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any
Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or
take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be
prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or reputation. Licensor
agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise
of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to
make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation,
modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original
Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert,
as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the
applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your
right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations)
but not otherwise.

5. Representations, Warranties and
Disclaimer

UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN
WRITING AND TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW,
LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED,
STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF
TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE,
NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY,
OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE.
SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES,
SO THIS EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

6. Limitation on Liability.
EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL
LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL,
INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT
OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN
ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. Termination

     a.
This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License.
Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections
from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses
terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full
compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will
survive any termination of this License.

     b. Subject to the above
terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the
duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the
above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different
license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided,
however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License
(or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted
under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in
full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.

8.
Miscellaneous

     a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform
the Work or a Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a
license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license
granted to You under this License.

     b. Each time You Distribute
or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor offers to the recipient a
license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the
license granted to You under this License.

     c. If any provision
of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it
shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of
the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties
to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum
extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.

    
d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no
breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing
and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.

  
  e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties
with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings,
agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified
here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that
may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be
modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and
You.

     f. The rights granted under, and the subject matter
referenced, in this License were drafted utilizing the terminology of
the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works
(as amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the
WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms
Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on
July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter take effect in the
relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be
enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the
implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable national
law. If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable
copyright law includes additional rights not granted under this
License, such additional rights are deemed to be included in the
License; this License is not intended to restrict the license of any
rights under applicable law.

 Creative Commons Corporation (“Creative Commons”)

Distribution of Creative Commons public licenses does not create a

Using
Creative Commons Public Licenses

Creative Commons public licenses
provide a standard set of terms and conditions that creators and other
rights holders may use to share original works of authorship and other
material subject to copyright and certain other rights specified in
the public license below. The following considerations are for
informational purposes only, are not exhaustive, and do not form part
of our licenses.

Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses
are intended for use by those authorized to give the public permission
to use material in ways otherwise restricted by copyright and certain
other rights. Our licenses are irrevocable. Licensors should read and
understand the terms and conditions of the license they choose before
applying it. Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before
applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the material as
expected. Licensors should clearly mark any material not subject to
the license. This includes other CC-licensed material, or material
used under an exception or limitation to copyright. More
considerations for licensors.

Considerations for the public: By using
one of our public licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to
use the licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If the
licensor’s permission is not necessary for any reason–for example,
because of any applicable exception or limitation to copyright–then
that use is not regulated by the license. Our licenses grant only
permissions under copyright and certain other rights that a licensor
has authority to grant. Use of the licensed material may still be
restricted for other reasons, including because others have copyright
or other rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests,
such as asking that all changes be marked or described. Although not
required by our licenses, you are encouraged to respect those requests
where reasonable. More considerations for the public. 

Creative
Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International Public
License

By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept
and agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative
Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International Public
License (""Public License""). To the extent this Public License may be
interpreted as a contract, You are granted the Licensed Rights in
consideration of Your acceptance of these terms and conditions, and
the Licensor grants You such rights in consideration of benefits the
Licensor receives from making the Licensed Material available under
these terms and conditions.

Section 1 – Definitions.
	
    
a.	Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar
Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material and in
which the Licensed Material is translated, altered, arranged,
transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring permission
under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the Licensor. For
purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed Material is a
musical work, performance, or sound recording, Adapted Material is
always produced where the Licensed Material is synched in timed
relation with a moving image.
	
     b.	Adapter's License means the

     e.	Effective
Technological Measures means those measures that, in the absence of
proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws fulfilling
obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright Treaty adopted on
December 20, 1996, and/or similar international agreements.
	
    
f.	Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or any
other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights that
applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.
	
     g.	License
Elements means the license attributes listed in the name of a Creative
Commons Public License. The License Elements of this Public License
are Attribution, NonCommercial, and ShareAlike.

Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.
	
    
j.	Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights
under this Public License.
	
     k.	NonCommercial means not primarily
intended for or directed towards commercial advantage or monetary

Rights by digital file-sharing or similar means is NonCommercial
provided there is no payment of monetary compensation in connection
with the exchange.
	
     l.	Share means to provide material to the
public by any means or process that requires permission under the
Licensed Rights, such as reproduction, public display, public
performance, distribution, dissemination, communication, or

ways that members of the public may access the material from a place
and at a time individually chosen by them.
	
     m.	Sui Generis
Database Rights means rights other than copyright resulting from
Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11
March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, as amended and/or
succeeded, as well as other essentially equivalent rights anywhere in
the world.
	
     n.	You means the individual or entity exercising the
Licensed Rights under this Public License. Your has a corresponding
meaning.

Section 2 – Scope.
	
     a.	License grant.
	
          1.
Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the
Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to exercise the
Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:

               A.
reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part, for

               B. produce,
reproduce, and Share Adapted Material for NonCommercial purposes
only.
	
          2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of
doubt, where Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public
License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with its terms
and conditions.
	
          3. Term. The term of this Public License
is specified in Section 6(a).
	
          4. Media and formats;
technical modifications allowed. The Licensor authorizes You to
exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats whether now
known or hereafter created, and to make technical modifications
necessary to do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert
any right or authority to forbid You from making technical
modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including
technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective
Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License, simply
making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)(4) never produces
Adapted Material.
	
          5. Downstream recipients.

             
 A. Offer from the Licensor – Licensed Material. Every recipient of
the Licensed Material automatically receives an offer from the
Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights under the terms and
conditions of this Public License.
	
               B. Additional
offer from the Licensor – Adapted Material. Every recipient of
Adapted Material from You automatically receives an offer from the
Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Adapted Material under
the conditions of the Adapter’s License You apply.
	
              
C. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose any
additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective
Technological Measures to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts
exercise of the Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed
Material.
	
          6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public
License constitutes or may be construed as permission to assert or
imply that You are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is,
connected with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,
the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as provided
in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).
	
     b.	Other rights.
	
          1. Moral
rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this
Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar
personality rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor
waives and/or agrees not to assert any such rights held by the
Licensor to the limited extent necessary to allow You to exercise the
Licensed Rights, but not otherwise.
	
          2. Patent and
trademark rights are not licensed under this Public License.
	
       
  3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect
royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether
directly or through a collecting society under any voluntary or
waivable statutory or compulsory licensing scheme. In all other cases
the Licensor expressly reserves any right to collect such royalties,
including when the Licensed Material is used other than for
NonCommercial purposes.

Section 3 – License Conditions.

Your
exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the
following conditions.

     a.	Attribution.
	
          1. If You
Share the Licensed Material (including in modified form), You must:
	

              A. retain the following if it is supplied by the
Licensor with the Licensed Material:

                   
i.	identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed Material and any
others designated to receive attribution, in any reasonable manner
requested by the Licensor (including by pseudonym if designated);

   
                ii.	a copyright notice;

                    iii. a
notice that refers to this Public License;

                    iv.	a
notice that refers to the disclaimer of warranties;

                 
  v.	a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the extent
reasonably practicable;
	
               B. indicate if You modified
the Licensed Material and retain an indication of any previous
modifications; and
	
               C. indicate the Licensed Material
is licensed under this Public License, and include the text of, or the
URI or hyperlink to, this Public License.
	
          2. You may
satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any reasonable manner
based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share the
Licensed Material. For example, it may be reasonable to satisfy the
conditions by providing a URI or hyperlink to a resource that includes
the required information.
	
          3. If requested by the Licensor,
You must remove any of the information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A)
to the extent reasonably practicable.
	
     b.	ShareAlike.In addition
to the conditions in Section 3(a), if You Share Adapted Material You
produce, the following conditions also apply.
	
          1. The
Adapter’s License You apply must be a Creative Commons license with
the same License Elements, this version or later, or a BY-NC-SA
Compatible License.
	
          2. You must include the text of, or
the URI or hyperlink to, the Adapter's License You apply. You may
satisfy this condition in any reasonable manner based on the medium,
means, and context in which You Share Adapted Material.
	
          3.
You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or
conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to,
Adapted Material that restrict exercise of the rights granted under
the Adapter's License You apply.

Section 4 – Sui Generis Database
Rights.

Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights
that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:
	
     a.	for the
avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to extract,
reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the
contents of the database for NonCommercial purposes only;
	
     b.	if
You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a
database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the
database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its
individual contents) is Adapted Material, including for purposes of
Section 3(b); and
	
     c.	You must comply with the conditions in
Section 3(a) if You Share all or a substantial portion of the contents
of the database.
For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4
supplements and does not replace Your obligations under this Public
License where the Licensed Rights include other Copyright and Similar
Rights.

Section 5 – Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of
Liability.
	
     a.	Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the
Licensor, to the extent possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed
Material as-is and as-available, and makes no representations or
warranties of any kind concerning the Licensed Material, whether
express, implied, statutory, or other. This includes, without
limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a
particular purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other
defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence of errors, whether or
not known or discoverable. Where disclaimers of warranties are not
allowed in full or in part, this disclaimer may not apply to You.
	
  
  b.	To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable
to You on any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence)
or otherwise for any direct, special, indirect, incidental,
consequential, punitive, exemplary, or other losses, costs, expenses,
or damages arising out of this Public License or use of the Licensed
Material, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of
such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where a limitation of
liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not
apply to You.
	
     c.	The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of
liability provided above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the
extent possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and
waiver of all liability.

Section 6 – Term and Termination.
	
    
a.	This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and
Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this
Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate
automatically.
	
     b.	Where Your right to use the Licensed Material
has terminated under Section 6(a), it reinstates:
	
         
1.	automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is
cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or
	
        
 2.	upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.
	
     c.	For the
avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the
Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public
License.
	
     d.	For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also
offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop
distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will
not terminate this Public License.
	
     e.	Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and
8 survive termination of this Public License.

Section 7 – Other
Terms and Conditions.
	
     a.	The Licensor shall not be bound by any
additional or different terms or conditions communicated by You unless
expressly agreed.
	
     b.	Any arrangements, understandings, or
agreements regarding the Licensed Material not stated herein are
separate from and independent of the terms and conditions of this
Public License.

Section 8 – Interpretation.
	
     a.	For the
avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not be
interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any
use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without
permission under this Public License.
	
     b.	To the extent
possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed
unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum
extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be
reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License without
affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions.
	

    c.	No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and
no failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the
Licensor.
	
     d.	Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may
be interpreted as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and
immunities that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal
processes of any jurisdiction or authority.

License

THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF
THIS CREATIVE COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE (""CCPL"" OR ""LICENSE""). THE WORK
IS PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE
WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE IS PROHIBITED.

BY
EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE
TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE
RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH
TERMS AND CONDITIONS.

1. Definitions

     a. ""Collective Work"" means
a work, such as a periodical issue, anthology or encyclopedia, in
which the Work in its entirety in unmodified form, along with a number
of other contributions, constituting separate and independent works in
themselves, are assembled into a collective whole. A work that
constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work
(as defined below) for the purposes of this License.

     b.
""Derivative Work"" means a work based upon the Work or upon the Work
and other pre-existing works, such as a translation, musical
arrangement, dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture version,
sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment, condensation, or any
other form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted,
except that a work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be
considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License.

     c.
""Licensor"" means the individual or entity that offers the Work under
the terms of this License.

     d. ""Original Author"" means the
individual or entity who created the Work.

     e. ""Work"" means the
copyrightable work of authorship offered under the terms of this
License.

     f. ""You"" means an individual or entity exercising
rights under this License who has not previously violated the terms of
this License with respect to the Work, or who has received express
permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License
despite a previous violation.

2. Fair Use Rights. Nothing in this
license is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any rights arising
from fair use, first sale or other limitations on the exclusive rights
of the copyright owner under copyright law or other applicable
laws.

3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
License, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable
copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work as stated
below:

     a. to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into
one or more Collective Works, and to reproduce the Work as
incorporated in the Collective Works;

     b. to distribute copies or
phonorecords of, display publicly, perform publicly, and perform
publicly by means of a digital audio transmission the Work including
as incorporated in Collective Works; 

The above rights may be
exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter
devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications
as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and
formats. All rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby
reserved.

4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is
expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:


    a. You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or
publicly digitally perform the Work only under the terms of this
License, and You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource
Identifier for, this License with every copy or phonorecord of the
Work You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly
digitally perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work
that alter or restrict the terms of this License or the recipients'
exercise of the rights granted hereunder. You may not sublicense the
Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and
to the disclaimer of warranties. You may not distribute, publicly
display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work with
any technological measures that control access or use of the Work in a
manner inconsistent with the terms of this License Agreement. The
above applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collective Work, but
this does not require the Collective Work apart from the Work itself
to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a
Collective Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent
practicable, remove from the Collective Work any reference to such
Licensor or the Original Author, as requested.

     b. If you
distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally
perform the Work or any Collective Works, You must keep intact all
copyright notices for the Work and give the Original Author credit
reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing by conveying the
name (or pseudonym if applicable) of the Original Author if supplied;
the title of the Work if supplied. Such credit may be implemented in
any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a
Collective Work, at a minimum such credit will appear where any other
comparable authorship credit appears and in a manner at least as
prominent as such other comparable authorship credit.

5.
Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer

     a. By offering the
Work for public release under this License, Licensor represents and
warrants that, to the best of Licensor's knowledge after reasonable
inquiry:

          i. Licensor has secured all rights in the Work
necessary to grant the license rights hereunder and to permit the
lawful exercise of the rights granted hereunder without You having any
obligation to pay any royalties, compulsory license fees, residuals or
any other payments;

          ii. The Work does not infringe the
copyright, trademark, publicity rights, common law rights or any other
right of any third party or constitute defamation, invasion of privacy

the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding
the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under
different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time;

continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated
above.

8. Miscellaneous

If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under
applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action
by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to
the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and
enforceable.

     c. No term or provision of this License shall be
deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent
shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such
waiver or consent.

     d. This License constitutes the entire
agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here.
There are no understandings, agreements or representations with

 CREATIVE COMMONS
CORPORATION IS NOT A LAW FIRM AND DOES NOT PROVIDE LEGAL SERVICES.

BASIS. CREATIVE COMMONS MAKES NO WARRANTIES REGARDING THE INFORMATION

License

THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF
THIS CREATIVE COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE (""CCPL"" OR ""LICENSE""). THE WORK
IS PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE
WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS
PROHIBITED.

BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU
ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. THE
LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR
ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.

1. Definitions

     a.
""Collective Work"" means a work, such as a periodical issue, anthology
or encyclopedia, in which the Work in its entirety in unmodified form,
along with a number of other contributions, constituting separate and
independent works in themselves, are assembled into a collective
whole. A work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be
considered a Derivative Work (as defined below) for the purposes of
this License.

     b. ""Derivative Work"" means a work based upon the
Work or upon the Work and other pre-existing works, such as a
translation, musical arrangement, dramatization, fictionalization,
motion picture version, sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment,
condensation, or any other form in which the Work may be recast,
transformed, or adapted, except that a work that constitutes a
Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work for the
purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is
a musical composition or sound recording, the synchronization of the
Work in timed-relation with a moving image (""synching"") will be
considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License.

     c.
""Licensor"" means the individual or entity that offers the Work under
the terms of this License.

     d. ""Original Author"" means the
individual or entity who created the Work.

     e. ""Work"" means the
copyrightable work of authorship offered under the terms of this
License.

     f. ""You"" means an individual or entity exercising
rights under this License who has not previously violated the terms of
this License with respect to the Work, or who has received express
permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License
despite a previous violation.

2. Fair Use Rights. Nothing in this
license is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any rights arising
from fair use, first sale or other limitations on the exclusive rights
of the copyright owner under copyright law or other applicable
laws.

3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
License, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable
copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work as stated
below:

     a. to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into
one or more Collective Works, and to reproduce the Work as
incorporated in the Collective Works;

     b. to distribute copies or
phonorecords of, display publicly, perform publicly, and perform
publicly by means of a digital audio transmission the Work including
as incorporated in Collective Works.

     c. For the avoidance of
doubt, where the work is a musical composition:

          i.
Performance Royalties Under Blanket Licenses. Licensor waives the
exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a performance
rights society (e.g. ASCAP, BMI, SESAC), royalties for the public
performance or public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the
Work.

          ii. Mechanical Rights and Statutory Royalties.
Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect, whether individually
or via a music rights society or designated agent (e.g. Harry Fox
Agency), royalties for any phonorecord You create from the Work
(""cover version"") and distribute, subject to the compulsory license
created by 17 USC Section 115 of the US Copyright Act (or the
equivalent in other jurisdictions).

     d. Webcasting Rights and
Statutory Royalties. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a
sound recording, Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect,
whether individually or via a performance-rights society (e.g.
SoundExchange), royalties for the public digital performance (e.g.
webcast) of the Work, subject to the compulsory license created by 17
USC Section 114 of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other
jurisdictions).

The above rights may be exercised in all media and
formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above rights
include the right to make such modifications as are technically
necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats, but
otherwise you have no rights to make Derivative Works. All rights not
expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.

4. Restrictions.
The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to
and limited by the following restrictions:

     a. You may
distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally
perform the Work only under the terms of this License, and You must
include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this
License with every copy or phonorecord of the Work You distribute,
publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform. You
may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that alter or restrict
the terms of this License or the recipients' exercise of the rights
granted hereunder. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep
intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of
warranties. You may not distribute, publicly display, publicly
perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work with any technological
measures that control access or use of the Work in a manner
inconsistent with the terms of this License Agreement. The above
applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collective Work, but this
does not require the Collective Work apart from the Work itself to be
made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collective
Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent
practicable, remove from the Collective Work any reference to such
Licensor or the Original Author, as requested.

     b. If you
distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally
perform the Work or Collective Works, You must keep intact all
copyright notices for the Work and give the Original Author credit
reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing by conveying the
name (or pseudonym if applicable) of the Original Author if supplied;
the title of the Work if supplied; and to the extent reasonably
practicable, the Uniform Resource Identifier, if any, that Licensor
specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not
refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work.
Such credit may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided,
however, that in the case of a Collective Work, at a minimum such
credit will appear where any other comparable authorship credit
appears and in a manner at least as prominent as such other comparable
authorship credit.

5. Representations, Warranties and
Disclaimer

UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN
WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS
OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE MATERIALS, EXPRESS, IMPLIED,
STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF
TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE,
NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY,
OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE.
SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES,
SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

6. Limitation on Liability.
EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL
LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL,
INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT
OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN
ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. Termination

     a.
This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License.
Individuals or entities who have received Collective Works from You
under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated
provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with
those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any
termination of this License.

     b. Subject to the above terms and
conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of
the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above,
Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different
license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided,
however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License
(or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted
under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in
full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.

8.
Miscellaneous

     a. Each time You distribute or publicly digitally
perform the Work, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to
the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to
You under this License.

     b. If any provision of this License is
invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the
validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this
License, and without further action by the parties to this agreement,
such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to
make such provision valid and enforceable.

     c. No term or
provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach
consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and
signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent. This
License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with
respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings,
agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified
here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that
may appear in any communication from You.

     d. This License may
not be modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor
and You.

means or process, including by wire or wireless means or public
digital performances; to make available to the public Works in such a
way that members of the public may access these Works from a place and
at a place individually chosen by them; to perform the Work to the
public by any means or process and the communication to the public of
the performances of the Work, including by public digital performance;
to broadcast and rebroadcast the Work by any means including signs,
sounds or images.

     i. ""Reproduce"" means to make copies of the
Work by any means including without limitation by sound or visual
recordings and the right of fixation and reproducing fixations of the
Work, including storage of a protected performance or phonogram in
digital form or other electronic medium.

2. Fair Dealing Rights.
Nothing in this License is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any
uses free from copyright or rights arising from limitations or
exceptions that are provided for in connection with the copyright
protection under copyright law or other applicable laws.

3. License
Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor
hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual
(for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the
rights in the Work as stated below:

     a. to Reproduce the Work, to
incorporate the Work into one or more Collections, and to Reproduce
the Work as incorporated in the Collections; and,

     b. to
Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated in
Collections.

     c. For the avoidance of doubt:

          i.
Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in
which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or
compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves
the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You
of the rights granted under this License;

          ii. Waivable
Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right
to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing
scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the exclusive right to
collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted
under this License; and,

          iii. Voluntary License Schemes.
The Licensor waives the right to collect royalties, whether
individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a member of a
collecting society that administers voluntary licensing schemes, via
that society, from any exercise by You of the rights granted under
this License.

The above rights may be exercised in all media and
formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above rights
include the right to make such modifications as are technically
necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats, but
otherwise you have no rights to make Adaptations. Subject to Section
8(f), all rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby
reserved.

4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is
expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:


    a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the
terms of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform
Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the
Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose
any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the
ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to
that recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense
the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License
and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You
Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly
Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological
measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the
Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under
the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as
incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection
apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this
License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You
must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit
as required by Section 4(b), as requested.

     b. If You Distribute,
or Publicly Perform the Work or Collections, You must, unless a
request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all
copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium
or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or
pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original Author
and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor
institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution (""Attribution
Parties"") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other
reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of
the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the
URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work,
unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing
information for the Work. The credit required by this Section 4(b) may
be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in
the case of a Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a
credit for all contributing authors of the Collection appears, then as
part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the
credits for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of
doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section for the
purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising
Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly
assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the
Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate,
of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express prior
written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution
Parties.

     c. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the
Licensor or as may be otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You
Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or
as part of any Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or
take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be
prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or reputation.

5.
Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer

UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY
AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS
AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE
WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER
DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR
NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF
IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

6.
Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE
LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY
FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY
DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF
LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7.
Termination

     a. This License and the rights granted hereunder
will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of
this License. Individuals or entities who have received Collections
from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses
terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full
compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will
survive any termination of this License.

     b. Subject to the above
terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the
duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the
above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different
license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided,
however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License
(or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted
under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in
full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.

8.
Miscellaneous

     a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform
the Work or a Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a
license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license
granted to You under this License.

     b. If any provision of this
License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not
affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of
this License, and without further action by the parties to this
agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent
necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.

     c. No
term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach
consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and
signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.

    
d. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties
with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings,
agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified
here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that
may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be
modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and
You.

     e. The rights granted under, and the subject matter
referenced, in this License were drafted utilizing the terminology of
the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works
(as amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the
WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms
Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on
July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter take effect in the
relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be
enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the
implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable national
law. If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable
copyright law includes additional rights not granted under this
License, such additional rights are deemed to be included in the
License; this License is not intended to restrict the license of any
rights under applicable law.

Creative Commons Corporation (“Creative Commons”) is not a law

of Creative Commons public licenses does not create a lawyer-client or
other relationship. Creative Commons makes its licenses and related

Using Creative Commons Public
Licenses

Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of
terms and conditions that creators and other rights holders may use to
share original works of authorship and other material subject to
copyright and certain other rights specified in the public license
below. The following considerations are for informational purposes
only, are not exhaustive, and do not form part of our
licenses.

Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are
intended for use by those authorized to give the public permission to
use material in ways otherwise restricted by copyright and certain
other rights. Our licenses are irrevocable. Licensors should read and
understand the terms and conditions of the license they choose before
applying it. Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before
applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the material as
expected. Licensors should clearly mark any material not subject to
the license. This includes other CC-licensed material, or material
used under an exception or limitation to copyright. More
considerations for licensors.

Considerations for the public: By using
one of our public licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to
use the licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If the
licensor’s permission is not necessary for any reason–for example,
because of any applicable exception or limitation to copyright–then
that use is not regulated by the license. Our licenses grant only
permissions under copyright and certain other rights that a licensor
has authority to grant. Use of the licensed material may still be
restricted for other reasons, including because others have copyright
or other rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests,
such as asking that all changes be marked or described. Although not
required by our licenses, you are encouraged to respect those requests
where reasonable. More considerations for the public.  

Creative
Commons Attribution-NoDerivatives 4.0 International Public License

By
exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree
to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons
Attribution-NoDerivatives 4.0 International Public License (""Public
License""). To the extent this Public License may be interpreted as a
contract, You are granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your
acceptance of these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You
such rights in consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from
making the Licensed Material available under these terms and
conditions.

Section 1 – Definitions.

     a.	Adapted Material
means material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights that is derived
from or based upon the Licensed Material and in which the Licensed
Material is translated, altered, arranged, transformed, or otherwise
modified in a manner requiring permission under the Copyright and
Similar Rights held by the Licensor. For purposes of this Public
License, where the Licensed Material is a musical work, performance,
or sound recording, Adapted Material is always produced where the
Licensed Material is synched in timed relation with a moving image.
	

    b.	Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar
rights closely related to copyright including, without limitation,
performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database
Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or categorized.
For purposes of this Public License, the rights specified in Section
2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar Rights.
	
     c.	Effective
Technological Measures means those measures that, in the absence of
proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws fulfilling
obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright Treaty adopted on
December 20, 1996, and/or similar international agreements.
	
    
d.	Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or any
other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights that
applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.
	
     e.	Licensed
Material means the artistic or literary work, database, or other
material to which the Licensor applied this Public License.
	
    
f.	Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the
terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to all
Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed
Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.
	
    
g.	Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights
under this Public License.
	
     h.	Share means to provide material
to the public by any means or process that requires permission under
the Licensed Rights, such as reproduction, public display, public
performance, distribution, dissemination, communication, or
importation, and to make material available to the public including in
ways that members of the public may access the material from a place
and at a time individually chosen by them.
	
     i.	Sui Generis
Database Rights means rights other than copyright resulting from
Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11
March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, as amended and/or
succeeded, as well as other essentially equivalent rights anywhere in
the world.
	
     j.	You means the individual or entity exercising the
Licensed Rights under this Public License. Your has a corresponding
meaning.

Section 2 – Scope.
	
     a.	License grant.
	
          1.
Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the
Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to exercise the
Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:

               A.
reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part; and
	

              B. produce and reproduce, but not Share, Adapted
Material.
	
          2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance
of doubt, where Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this
Public License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with its
terms and conditions.
	
          3. Term. The term of this Public
License is specified in Section 6(a).
	
          4. Media and
formats; technical modifications allowed. The Licensor authorizes You
to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats whether now
known or hereafter created, and to make technical modifications
necessary to do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert
any right or authority to forbid You from making technical
modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including
technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective
Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License, simply
making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)(4) never produces
Adapted Material.
	
          5. Downstream recipients.

             
 A. Offer from the Licensor – Licensed Material. Every recipient of
the Licensed Material automatically receives an offer from the
Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights under the terms and
conditions of this Public License.
	
               B. No downstream
restrictions. You may not offer or impose any additional or different
terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures
to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the
Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed Material.
	
         
6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may
be construed as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that
Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected with, or sponsored,
endorsed, or granted official status by, the Licensor or others
designated to receive attribution as provided in Section
3(a)(1)(A)(i).
	
     b.	Other rights.
	
          1. Moral rights,
such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this Public
License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar personality
rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or
agrees not to assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the
limited extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights,
but not otherwise.
	
          2. Patent and trademark rights are not
licensed under this Public License.
	
          3. To the extent
possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect royalties from You
for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether directly or through a
collecting society under any voluntary or waivable statutory or
compulsory licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly
reserves any right to collect such royalties.

Section 3 – License
Conditions.

Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made
subject to the following conditions.
  
     a.	Attribution.
	
       
  1. If You Share the Licensed Material, You must:

               A.
retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor with the
Licensed Material:

                    i. identification of the
creator(s) of the Licensed Material and any others designated to
receive attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by the
Licensor (including by pseudonym if designated);

                   
ii.	a copyright notice;

                    iii. a notice that refers
to this Public License;

                    iv.	a notice that refers
to the disclaimer of warranties;

                    v.	a URI or
hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the extent reasonably
practicable;
	
               B. indicate if You modified the Licensed
Material and retain an indication of any previous modifications; and


              C. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this
Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to,
this Public License.
	
          2. For the avoidance of doubt, You do
not have permission under this Public License to Share Adapted
Material.
	
          3. You may satisfy the conditions in Section
3(a)(1) in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and
context in which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may
be reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or
hyperlink to a resource that includes the required information.
	
    
     4. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the
information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent reasonably
practicable.

Section 4 – Sui Generis Database Rights.

Where the
Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your
use of the Licensed Material:
	
     a.	for the avoidance of doubt,
Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to extract, reuse, reproduce, and
Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database,
provided You do not Share Adapted Material;
	
     b.	if You include
all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a database in
which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in which
You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents)
is Adapted Material; and
	
     c.	You must comply with the conditions
in Section 3(a) if You Share all or a substantial portion of the
contents of the database.
For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4
supplements and does not replace Your obligations under this Public
License where the Licensed Rights include other Copyright and Similar
Rights.

Section 5 – Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of
Liability.
	
     a.	Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the
Licensor, to the extent possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed
Material as-is and as-available, and makes no representations or
warranties of any kind concerning the Licensed Material, whether
express, implied, statutory, or other. This includes, without
limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a
particular purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other
defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence of errors, whether or
not known or discoverable. Where disclaimers of warranties are not
allowed in full or in part, this disclaimer may not apply to You.
	
  
  b.	To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable
to You on any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence)
or otherwise for any direct, special, indirect, incidental,
consequential, punitive, exemplary, or other losses, costs, expenses,
or damages arising out of this Public License or use of the Licensed
Material, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of
such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where a limitation of
liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not
apply to You.
	
     c.	The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of
liability provided above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the
extent possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and
waiver of all liability.

Section 6 – Term and Termination.
	
    
a.	This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and
Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this
Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate
automatically.
	
     b.	Where Your right to use the Licensed Material
has terminated under Section 6(a), it reinstates:
	
          1.
automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is
cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or
         

          2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.
	
    
c.	For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any
right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of
this Public License.
	
     d.	For the avoidance of doubt, the
Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or
conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time;
however, doing so will not terminate this Public License.
	
    
e.	Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public
License.

Section 7 – Other Terms and Conditions.
	
     a.	The
Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or
conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.
	
     b.	Any
arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed
Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the
terms and conditions of this Public License.

Section 8 –
Interpretation.
	
     a.	For the avoidance of doubt, this Public
License does not, and shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit,
restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the Licensed Material
that could lawfully be made without permission under this Public
License.
	
     b.	To the extent possible, if any provision of this
Public License is deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically
reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If
the provision cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public
License without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms
and conditions.
	
     c.	No term or condition of this Public License
will be waived and no failure to comply consented to unless expressly
agreed to by the Licensor.
	
     d.	Nothing in this Public License
constitutes or may be interpreted as a limitation upon, or waiver of,
any privileges and immunities that apply to the Licensor or You,
including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction or
authority.

License

THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF
THIS CREATIVE COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE (""CCPL"" OR ""LICENSE""). THE WORK

which the Work in its entirety in unmodified form, along with a number
of other contributions, constituting separate and independent works in
themselves, are assembled into a collective whole. A work that
constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work
(as defined below) for the purposes of this License.

""Derivative Work"" means a work based upon the Work or upon the Work
and other pre-existing works, such as a translation, musical
arrangement, dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture version,
sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment, condensation, or any

of the copyright owner under copyright law or other applicable
laws.

one or more Collective Works, and to reproduce the Work as
incorporated in the Collective Works;

     b. to create and reproduce
Derivative Works;

     c. to distribute copies or phonorecords of,
display publicly, perform publicly, and perform publicly by means of a
digital audio transmission the Work including as incorporated in
Collective Works;

     d. to distribute copies or phonorecords of,
display publicly, perform publicly, and perform publicly by means of a
digital audio transmission Derivative Works;

The above rights may be
exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter
devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications
as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and
formats. All rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby
reserved.

4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is
expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:


    a. You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or
publicly digitally perform the Work only under the terms of this
License, and You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource
Identifier for, this License with every copy or phonorecord of the
Work You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly
digitally perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work
that alter or restrict the terms of this License or the recipients'
exercise of the rights granted hereunder. You may not sublicense the
Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and
to the disclaimer of warranties. You may not distribute, publicly
display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work with
any technological measures that control access or use of the Work in a
manner inconsistent with the terms of this License Agreement. The
above applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collective Work, but
this does not require the Collective Work apart from the Work itself
to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a
Collective Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent
practicable, remove from the Collective Work any reference to such
Licensor or the Original Author, as requested. If You create a
Derivative Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent
practicable, remove from the Derivative Work any reference to such
Licensor or the Original Author, as requested.

     b. You may
distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally
perform a Derivative Work only under the terms of this License, and
You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for,
this License with every copy or phonorecord of each Derivative Work
You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly
digitally perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the
Derivative Works that alter or restrict the terms of this License or
the recipients' exercise of the rights granted hereunder, and You must
keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the
disclaimer of warranties. You may not distribute, publicly display,
publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Derivative Work
with any technological measures that control access or use of the Work
in a manner inconsistent with the terms of this License Agreement. The
above applies to the Derivative Work as incorporated in a Collective
Work, but this does not require the Collective Work apart from the
Derivative Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this
License.

     c. If you distribute, publicly display, publicly
perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work or any Derivative
Works or Collective Works, You must keep intact all copyright notices
for the Work and give the Original Author credit reasonable to the
medium or means You are utilizing by conveying the name (or pseudonym
if applicable) of the Original Author if supplied; the title of the
Work if supplied; in the case of a Derivative Work, a credit
identifying the use of the Work in the Derivative Work (e.g., ""French
translation of the Work by Original Author,"" or ""Screenplay based on
original Work by Original Author""). Such credit may be implemented in
any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a
Derivative Work or Collective Work, at a minimum such credit will
appear where any other comparable authorship credit appears and in a
manner at least as prominent as such other comparable authorship
credit.

5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer

     a. By
offering the Work for public release under this License, Licensor
represents and warrants that, to the best of Licensor's knowledge
after reasonable inquiry:

           i. Licensor has secured all
rights in the Work necessary to grant the license rights hereunder and
to permit the lawful exercise of the rights granted hereunder without
You having any obligation to pay any royalties, compulsory license
fees, residuals or any other payments;

          ii. The Work does
not infringe the copyright, trademark, publicity rights, common law
rights or any other right of any third party or constitute defamation,
invasion of privacy or other tortious injury to any third party.

    
b. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY STATED IN THIS LICENSE OR OTHERWISE AGREED IN
WRITING OR REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE WORK IS LICENSED ON AN ""AS
IS"" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED
INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES REGARDING THE CONTENTS
OR ACCURACY OF THE WORK.

6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE
EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, AND EXCEPT FOR DAMAGES ARISING FROM
LIABILITY TO A THIRD PARTY RESULTING FROM BREACH OF THE WARRANTIES IN
SECTION 5, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL
THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK,
EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES.

7. Termination

     a. This License and the rights granted
hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the
terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received
Derivative Works or Collective Works from You under this License,
however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such
individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses.
Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this
License.

     b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the
license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable
copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves
the right to release the Work under different license terms or to stop
distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such
election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license
that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this
License), and this License will continue in full force and effect
unless terminated as stated above.

8. Miscellaneous

     a. Each
time You distribute or publicly digitally perform the Work or a
Collective Work, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the
Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You
under this License.

     b. Each time You distribute or publicly
digitally perform a Derivative Work, Licensor offers to the recipient
a license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the
license granted to You under this License.

     c. If any provision
of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it
shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of
the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties
to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum
extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.

    
d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no
breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing
and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.

  
  e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties
with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings,
agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified
here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that
may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be
modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.

license. Notwithstanding the foregoing two (2) sentences, if Creative

shall have all rights and obligations of Licensor.

License

THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF
THIS CREATIVE COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE (""CCPL"" OR ""LICENSE""). THE WORK
IS PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE
WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS
PROHIBITED.

BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU
ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. THE
LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR
ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.

1. Definitions

     a.
""Collective Work"" means a work, such as a periodical issue, anthology
or encyclopedia, in which the Work in its entirety in unmodified form,
along with a number of other contributions, constituting separate and
independent works in themselves, are assembled into a collective
whole. A work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be
considered a Derivative Work (as defined below) for the purposes of
this License.

     b. ""Derivative Work"" means a work based upon the
Work or upon the Work and other pre-existing works, such as a
translation, musical arrangement, dramatization, fictionalization,
motion picture version, sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment,
condensation, or any other form in which the Work may be recast,
transformed, or adapted, except that a work that constitutes a
Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work for the
purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is
a musical composition or sound recording, the synchronization of the
Work in timed-relation with a moving image (""synching"") will be
considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License.

     c.
""Licensor"" means the individual or entity that offers the Work under
the terms of this License.

     d. ""Original Author"" means the
individual or entity who created the Work.

     e. ""Work"" means the
copyrightable work of authorship offered under the terms of this
License.

     f. ""You"" means an individual or entity exercising
rights under this License who has not previously violated the terms of
this License with respect to the Work, or who has received express
permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License
despite a previous violation.

     g. ""License Elements"" means the
following high-level license attributes as selected by Licensor and
indicated in the title of this License: Attribution, ShareAlike.

2.
Fair Use Rights. Nothing in this license is intended to reduce, limit,
or restrict any rights arising from fair use, first sale or other
limitations on the exclusive rights of the copyright owner under
copyright law or other applicable laws.

3. License Grant. Subject to
the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants You a
worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of
the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work
as stated below:

     a. to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the
Work into one or more Collective Works, and to reproduce the Work as
incorporated in the Collective Works;

     b. to create and reproduce
Derivative Works; 

     c. to distribute copies or phonorecords of,
display publicly, perform publicly, and perform publicly by means of a
digital audio transmission the Work including as incorporated in
Collective Works;

     d. to distribute copies or phonorecords of,
display publicly, perform publicly, and perform publicly by means of a
digital audio transmission Derivative Works.

     e. For the
avoidance of doubt, where the work is a musical composition:

        
 i. Performance Royalties Under Blanket Licenses. Licensor waives the
exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a performance
rights society (e.g. ASCAP, BMI, SESAC), royalties for the public
performance or public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the
Work.

          ii. Mechanical Rights and Statutory Royalties.
Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect, whether individually
or via a music rights society or designated agent (e.g. Harry Fox
Agency), royalties for any phonorecord You create from the Work
(""cover version"") and distribute, subject to the compulsory license
created by 17 USC Section 115 of the US Copyright Act (or the
equivalent in other jurisdictions).

     f. Webcasting Rights and
Statutory Royalties. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a
sound recording, Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect,
whether individually or via a performance-rights society (e.g.
SoundExchange), royalties for the public digital performance (e.g.
webcast) of the Work, subject to the compulsory license created by 17
USC Section 114 of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other
jurisdictions).

The above rights may be exercised in all media and
formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above rights
include the right to make such modifications as are technically
necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats. All
rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.

4.
Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made
subject to and limited by the following restrictions:

     a. You may
distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally
perform the Work only under the terms of this License, and You must
include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this
License with every copy or phonorecord of the Work You distribute,
publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform. You
may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that alter or restrict
the terms of this License or the recipients' exercise of the rights
granted hereunder. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep
intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of
warranties. You may not distribute, publicly display, publicly
perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work with any technological
measures that control access or use of the Work in a manner
inconsistent with the terms of this License Agreement. The above
applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collective Work, but this
does not require the Collective Work apart from the Work itself to be
made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collective
Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent
practicable, remove from the Collective Work any reference to such
Licensor or the Original Author, as requested. If You create a
Derivative Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent
practicable, remove from the Derivative Work any reference to such
Licensor or the Original Author, as requested.

     b. You may
distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally
perform a Derivative Work only under the terms of this License, a
later version of this License with the same License Elements as this
License, or a Creative Commons iCommons license that contains the same
License Elements as this License (e.g. Attribution-ShareAlike 2.0
Japan). You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier
for, this License or other license specified in the previous sentence
with every copy or phonorecord of each Derivative Work You distribute,
publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform. You
may not offer or impose any terms on the Derivative Works that alter
or restrict the terms of this License or the recipients' exercise of
the rights granted hereunder, and You must keep intact all notices
that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties. You
may not distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly
digitally perform the Derivative Work with any technological measures
that control access or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with
the terms of this License Agreement. The above applies to the
Derivative Work as incorporated in a Collective Work, but this does
not require the Collective Work apart from the Derivative Work itself
to be made subject to the terms of this License.

     c. If you
distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally
perform the Work or any Derivative Works or Collective Works, You must
keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and give the Original
Author credit reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing by
conveying the name (or pseudonym if applicable) of the Original Author
if supplied; the title of the Work if supplied; to the extent
reasonably practicable, the Uniform Resource Identifier, if any, that
Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI
does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for
the Work; and in the case of a Derivative Work, a credit identifying
the use of the Work in the Derivative Work (e.g., ""French translation
of the Work by Original Author,"" or ""Screenplay based on original Work
by Original Author""). Such credit may be implemented in any reasonable
manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Derivative Work or
Collective Work, at a minimum such credit will appear where any other
comparable authorship credit appears and in a manner at least as
prominent as such other comparable authorship credit.

5.
Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer

UNLESS OTHERWISE AGREED TO
BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO
REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE MATERIALS,
EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER
DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR
NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF
IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

6.
Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE
LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY
FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY
DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF
LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7.
Termination

     a. This License and the rights granted hereunder
will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of
this License. Individuals or entities who have received Derivative
Works or Collective Works from You under this License, however, will
not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or
entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2,
5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.

     b.
Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is
perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work).
Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the
Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at
any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to
withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is
required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this
License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as
stated above.

8. Miscellaneous

     a. Each time You distribute or
publicly digitally perform the Work or a Collective Work, the Licensor
offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and
conditions as the license granted to You under this License.

     b.
Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform a Derivative
Work, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work
on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under
this License.

     c. If any provision of this License is invalid or
unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity
or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and
without further action by the parties to this agreement, such
provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make
such provision valid and enforceable.

     d. No term or provision of
this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless
such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to
be charged with such waiver or consent.

     e. This License
constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to
the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or
representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor
shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any
communication from You. This License may not be modified without the
mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.

foregoing two (2) sentences, if Creative Commons has expressly
identified itself as the Licensor hereunder, it shall have all rights
and obligations of Licensor.

publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the
Derivative Work with any technological measures that control access or
use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with the terms of this
License Agreement. The above applies to the Derivative Work as
incorporated in a Collective Work, but this does not require the
Collective Work apart from the Derivative Work itself to be made
subject to the terms of this License.

     c. If you distribute,
publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the
Work or any Derivative Works or Collective Works, You must keep intact

medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author
(or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or (ii) if the Original
Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g. a
sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution in
Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable
means, the name of such party or parties; the title of the Work if

EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL
LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL,

7. Termination

     a.
This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate

above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for
the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding
the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under
different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time;
provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw
this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to
be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will
continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated
above.

8. Miscellaneous

     a. Each time You distribute or publicly
digitally perform the Work or a Collective Work, the Licensor offers
to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and
conditions as the license granted to You under this License.

     b.
Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform a Derivative
Work, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work
on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under
this License.

     c. If any provision of this License is invalid or
unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity
or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and
without further action by the parties to this agreement, such
provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make
such provision valid and enforceable.

     d. No term or provision of
this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless
such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to
be charged with such waiver or consent.

     e. This License

the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or
representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor
shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any
communication from You. This License may not be modified without the

of a literary or artistic work, or phonogram or performance and
includes cinematographic adaptations or any other form in which the
Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted including in any form
recognizably derived from the original, except that a work that
constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation for the
purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is
a musical work, performance or phonogram, the synchronization of the
Work in timed-relation with a moving image (""synching"") will be
considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this License.

     b.
""Collection"" means a collection of literary or artistic works, such as
encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances, phonograms or
broadcasts, or other works or subject matter other than works listed
in Section 1(f) below, which, by reason of the selection and
arrangement of their contents, constitute intellectual creations, in
which the Work is included in its entirety in unmodified form along
with one or more other contributions, each constituting separate and
independent works in themselves, which together are assembled into a
collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collection will not be
considered an Adaptation (as defined below) for the purposes of this
License.

     c. ""Creative Commons Compatible License"" means a

adaptations of works made available under that license under this
License or a Creative Commons jurisdiction license with the same
License Elements as this License.

     d. ""Distribute"" means to make
available to the public the original and copies of the Work or
Adaptation, as appropriate, through sale or other transfer of
ownership.

performance the actors, singers, musicians, dancers, and other persons
who act, sing, deliver, declaim, play in, interpret or otherwise
perform literary or artistic works or expressions of folklore; (ii) in
the case of a phonogram the producer being the person or legal entity
who first fixes the sounds of a performance or other sounds; and,

     h. ""Work"" means the literary and/or artistic work
offered under the terms of this License including without limitation
any production in the literary, scientific and artistic domain,
whatever may be the mode or form of its expression including digital
form, such as a book, pamphlet and other writing; a lecture, address,
sermon or other work of the same nature; a dramatic or
dramatico-musical work; a choreographic work or entertainment in dumb

work of applied art; an illustration, map, plan, sketch or
three-dimensional work relative to geography, topography, architecture
or science; a performance; a broadcast; a phonogram; a compilation of
data to the extent it is protected as a copyrightable work; or a work
performed by a variety or circus performer to the extent it is not
otherwise considered a literary or artistic work.

     i. ""You"" means
an individual or entity exercising rights under this License who has
not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to the
Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to
exercise rights under this License despite a previous violation.

    
j. ""Publicly Perform"" means to perform public recitations of the Work
and to communicate to the public those public recitations, by any
means or process, including by wire or wireless means or public
digital performances; to make available to the public Works in such a
way that members of the public may access these Works from a place and
at a place individually chosen by them; to perform the Work to the
public by any means or process and the communication to the public of
the performances of the Work, including by public digital performance;
to broadcast and rebroadcast the Work by any means including signs,

     k. ""Reproduce"" means to make copies of the
Work by any means including without limitation by sound or visual
recordings and the right of fixation and reproducing fixations of the

2. Fair Dealing Rights.
Nothing in this License is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any
uses free from copyright or rights arising from limitations or
exceptions that are provided for in connection with the copyright
protection under copyright law or other applicable laws.

3. License
Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor
hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual
(for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the
rights in the Work as stated below:

     a. to Reproduce the Work, to
incorporate the Work into one or more Collections, and to Reproduce
the Work as incorporated in the Collections;

     b. to create and
Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such Adaptation, including any
translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps to clearly label,
demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made to the original
Work. For example, a translation could be marked ""The original work
was translated from English to Spanish,"" or a modification could
indicate ""The original work has been modified."";

     c. to
Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated in
Collections; and,

     d. to Distribute and Publicly Perform
Adaptations.

     e. For the avoidance of doubt:

          i.
Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in
which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or
compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves
the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You
of the rights granted under this License;

          ii. Waivable
Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right
to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing
scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the exclusive right to
collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted
under this License; and,

          iii. Voluntary License Schemes.
The Licensor waives the right to collect royalties, whether
individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a member of a
collecting society that administers voluntary licensing schemes, via
that society, from any exercise by You of the rights granted under
this License.

The above rights may be exercised in all media and
formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above rights
include the right to make such modifications as are technically
necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats. Subject
to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly granted by Licensor are
hereby reserved.

4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3
above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following
restrictions:

     a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work
only under the terms of this License. You must include a copy of, or
the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every
copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer
or impose any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this
License or the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the
rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. You
may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that
refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every
copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You
Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any
effective technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability
of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to
that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a)
applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not
require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made subject
to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection, upon notice
from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the
Collection any credit as required by Section 4(c), as requested. If
You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to
the extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as
required by Section 4(c), as requested.

     b. You may Distribute or
Publicly Perform an Adaptation only under the terms of: (i) this
License; (ii) a later version of this License with the same License
Elements as this License; (iii) a Creative Commons jurisdiction
license (either this or a later license version) that contains the
same License Elements as this License (e.g., Attribution-ShareAlike
3.0 US)); (iv) a Creative Commons Compatible License. If you license
the Adaptation under one of the licenses mentioned in (iv), you must
comply with the terms of that license. If you license the Adaptation
under the terms of any of the licenses mentioned in (i), (ii) or (iii)
(the ""Applicable License""), you must comply with the terms of the
Applicable License generally and the following provisions: (I) You
must include a copy of, or the URI for, the Applicable License with
every copy of each Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform; (II)
You may not offer or impose any terms on the Adaptation that restrict
the terms of the Applicable License or the ability of the recipient of
the Adaptation to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under
the terms of the Applicable License; (III) You must keep intact all
notices that refer to the Applicable License and to the disclaimer of
warranties with every copy of the Work as included in the Adaptation
You Distribute or Publicly Perform; (IV) when You Distribute or
Publicly Perform the Adaptation, You may not impose any effective
technological measures on the Adaptation that restrict the ability of
a recipient of the Adaptation from You to exercise the rights granted
to that recipient under the terms of the Applicable License. This
Section 4(b) applies to the Adaptation as incorporated in a
Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the
Adaptation itself to be made subject to the terms of the Applicable
License.

     c. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or
any Adaptations or Collections, You must, unless a request has been
made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for
the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are
utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if
applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor
designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute,
publishing entity, journal) for attribution (""Attribution Parties"") in
Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable
means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work
if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if
any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless
such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing
information for the Work; and (iv) , consistent with Ssection 3(b), in
the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in
the Adaptation (e.g., ""French translation of the Work by Original
Author,"" or ""Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author"").
The credit required by this Section 4(c) may be implemented in any
reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation
or Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for
all contributing authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then
as part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the
credits for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of
doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section for the
purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising
Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly
assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the
Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate,
of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express prior
written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution
Parties.

     d. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the
Licensor or as may be otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You
Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or
as part of any Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort,
mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in relation to the
Work which would be prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or
reputation. Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan),
in which any exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this
License (the right to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a
distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory action
prejudicial to the Original Author's honor and reputation, the
Licensor will waive or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to
the fullest extent permitted by the applicable national law, to enable
You to reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this
License (right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise.

5.
Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer

UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY
AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS
AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE
WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER
DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR
NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF
IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

6.
Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE
LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY
FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY
DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF
LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7.
Termination

     a. This License and the rights granted hereunder
will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of
this License. Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or
Collections from You under this License, however, will not have their
licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in
full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8
will survive any termination of this License.

     b. Subject to the
above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for
the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding
the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under
different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time;
provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw
this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to
be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will
continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated
above.

8. Miscellaneous

     a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly
Perform the Work or a Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient
a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license
granted to You under this License.

     b. Each time You Distribute
or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor offers to the recipient a
license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the
license granted to You under this License.

     c. If any provision
of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it
shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of
the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties
to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum
extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.

    
d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no
breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing
and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.

  
  e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties
with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings,
agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified
here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that
may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be
modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and
You.

     f. The rights granted under, and the subject matter
referenced, in this License were drafted utilizing the terminology of
the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works
(as amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the
WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms
Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on
July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter take effect in the
relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be
enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the
implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable national
law. If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable
copyright law includes additional rights not granted under this
License, such additional rights are deemed to be included in the
License; this License is not intended to restrict the license of any
rights under applicable law.

license. Notwithstanding the foregoing two (2) sentences, if Creative
Commons has expressly identified itself as the Licensor hereunder, it
shall have all rights and obligations of Licensor.

Using Creative Commons Public
Licenses

Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of
terms and conditions that creators and other rights holders may use to
share original works of authorship and other material subject to
copyright and certain other rights specified in the public license
below. The following considerations are for informational purposes
only, are not exhaustive, and do not form part of our
licenses.

Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are
intended for use by those authorized to give the public permission to
use material in ways otherwise restricted by copyright and certain
other rights. Our licenses are irrevocable. Licensors should read and
understand the terms and conditions of the license they choose before
applying it. Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before
applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the material as
expected. Licensors should clearly mark any material not subject to
the license. This includes other CC-licensed material, or material
used under an exception or limitation to copyright. More
considerations for licensors.

Considerations for the public: By using
one of our public licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to
use the licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If the
licensor’s permission is not necessary for any reason–for example,
because of any applicable exception or limitation to copyright–then
that use is not regulated by the license. Our licenses grant only
permissions under copyright and certain other rights that a licensor
has authority to grant. Use of the licensed material may still be
restricted for other reasons, including because others have copyright
or other rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests,
such as asking that all changes be marked or described. 

Although not
required by our licenses, you are encouraged to respect those requests
where reasonable. More considerations for the public.

to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats whether now
known or hereafter created, and to make technical modifications
necessary to do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert
any right or authority to forbid You from making technical
modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including
technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective
Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License, simply
making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)(4) never produces
Adapted Material.
	
          5. Downstream recipients.

             
 A. Offer from the Licensor – Licensed Material. Every recipient of
the Licensed Material automatically receives an offer from the
Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights under the terms and
conditions of this Public License.
	
               B. Additional
offer from the Licensor – Adapted Material. Every recipient of
Adapted Material from You automatically receives an offer from the
Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Adapted Material under
the conditions of the Adapter’s License You apply.
	
              
C. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose any
additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective
Technological Measures to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts
exercise of the Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed
Material.
	
          6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public
License constitutes or may be construed as permission to assert or
imply that You are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is,
connected with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,
the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as provided
in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).
	
     b.	Other rights.
	
          1. Moral
rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this
Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar
personality rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor
waives and/or agrees not to assert any such rights held by the
Licensor to the limited extent necessary to allow You to exercise the
Licensed Rights, but not otherwise.
	
          2. Patent and
trademark rights are not licensed under this Public License.
	
       
  3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect
royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether
directly or through a collecting society under any voluntary or
waivable statutory or compulsory licensing scheme. In all other cases
the Licensor expressly reserves any right to collect such
royalties.

the rights granted under the Adapter's License You apply.

Section 4
– Sui Generis Database Rights.

Where the Licensed Rights include
Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed
Material:
	
     a.	for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants
You the right to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a
substantial portion of the contents of the database;
	
     b.	if You
include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a
database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the
database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its
individual contents) is Adapted Material, including for purposes of
Section 3(b); and
	
     c.	You must comply with the conditions in
Section 3(a) if You Share all or a substantial portion of the contents
of the database.
For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4
supplements and does not replace Your obligations under this Public
License where the Licensed Rights include other Copyright and Similar
Rights.

Section 5 – Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of
Liability.

Licensor, to the extent possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed

limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a
particular purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other
defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence of errors, whether or
not known or discoverable. Where disclaimers of warranties are not

to You on any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence)
or otherwise for any direct, special, indirect, incidental,
consequential, punitive, exemplary, or other losses, costs, expenses,
or damages arising out of this Public License or use of the Licensed
Material, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of
such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where a limitation of
liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not
apply to You.
	
     c.	The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of
liability provided above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the
extent possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and
waiver of all liability.

Section 6 – Term and Termination.
	
    
a.	This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and
Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this
Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate
automatically.
	
     b.	Where Your right to use the Licensed Material
has terminated under Section 6(a), it reinstates:
	
          1.
automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is
cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or
	
        
 2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.
	
     c.	For the
avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the
Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public
License.

offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop
distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will

expressly agreed.
	
     b.	Any arrangements, understandings, or
agreements regarding the Licensed Material not stated herein are

Public License.

Section 8 – Interpretation.
	
     a.	For the
avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not be
interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any
use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without
permission under this Public License.
	
     b.	To the extent
possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed
unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum
extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be
reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License without
affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions.
	

    c.	No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and
no failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the
Licensor.
	
     d.	Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may
be interpreted as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and
immunities that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal
processes of any jurisdiction or authority.

 CREATIVE COMMONS CORPORATION IS
NOT A LAW FIRM AND DOES NOT PROVIDE LEGAL SERVICES. DISTRIBUTION OF
THIS DOCUMENT DOES NOT CREATE AN ATTORNEY-CLIENT RELATIONSHIP.
CREATIVE COMMONS PROVIDES THIS INFORMATION ON AN ""AS-IS"" BASIS.
CREATIVE COMMONS MAKES NO WARRANTIES REGARDING THE USE OF THIS
DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS PROVIDED HEREUNDER, AND DISCLAIMS
LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE
INFORMATION OR WORKS PROVIDED HEREUNDER.  

Statement of Purpose

The
laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the
creator and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an ""owner"") of an
original work of authorship and/or a database (each, a
""Work"").

Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights
to a Work for the purpose of contributing to a commons of creative,
cultural and scientific works (""Commons"") that the public can reliably
and without fear of later claims of infringement build upon, modify,
incorporate in other works, reuse and redistribute as freely as
possible in any form whatsoever and for any purposes, including
without limitation commercial purposes. These owners may contribute to
the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further
production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain
reputation or greater distribution for their Work in part through the
use and efforts of others.

For these and/or other purposes and
motivations, and without any expectation of additional consideration
or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a Work (the
""Affirmer""), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright and
Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the
Work and publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge
of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning
and intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights.

1. Copyright and
Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be protected by
copyright and related or neighboring rights (""Copyright and Related
Rights""). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited
to, the following:

     i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute,
perform, display, communicate, and translate a Work;

     ii. moral
rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);

    
iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or
likeness depicted in a Work;

     iv. rights protecting against
unfair competition in regards to a Work, subject to the limitations in
paragraph 4(a), below;

     v. rights protecting the extraction,
dissemination, use and reuse of data in a Work;

     vi. database
rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the European
Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection
of databases, and under any national implementation thereof, including
any amended or successor version of such directive); and

     vii.
other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world
based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations
thereof.

2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in
contravention of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully,
permanently, irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and
surrenders all of Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and
associated claims and causes of action, whether now known or unknown
(including existing as well as future claims and causes of action), in
the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum
duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time
extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number
of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without
limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the
""Waiver""). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of
the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and
successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be subject to
revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other legal
or equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the
public as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.

3.
Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason
be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then
the Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking
into account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to
the extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each
affected person a royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable,
non exclusive, irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise
Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work (i) in all
territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by
applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in
any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv)
for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial,
advertising or promotional purposes (the ""License""). The License shall
be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the
Work. Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally
invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity
or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License,
and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i)
exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in
the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of action
with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's
express Statement of Purpose.

4. Limitations and Disclaimers.

    
a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived,
abandoned, surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this
document.

     b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no
representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Work,
express, implied, statutory or otherwise, including without limitation
warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular
purpose, non infringement, or the absence of latent or other defects,
accuracy, or the present or absence of errors, whether or not
discoverable, all to the greatest extent permissible under applicable
law.

     c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of
other persons that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including
without limitation any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the
Work. Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any
necessary consents, permissions or other rights required for any use
of the Work.

     d. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that
Creative Commons is not a party to this document and has no duty or
obligation with respect to this CC0 or use of the Work.

reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software
exchange.

You must include a
notice in each of Your Modifications that identifies You as the

3.4.
Application of Additional Terms.
You may not offer or impose any terms
on any Covered Software in Source Code form that alters or restricts
the applicable version of this License or the recipients’ rights
hereunder. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty,
support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients
of Covered Software. However, you may do so only on Your own behalf,
and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You
must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support,
indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You
hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor
for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such
Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability
terms You offer.

You may
distribute the Executable form of the Covered Software under the terms
of this License or under the terms of a license of Your choice, which
may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are

the Executable form does not attempt to limit or alter the
recipient’s rights in the Source Code form from the rights set forth
in this License. If You distribute the Covered Software in Executable
form under a different license, You must make it absolutely clear that
any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not

such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are
fulfilled for the Covered Software.

4. Versions of the License.

4.1.
New Versions.
Sun Microsystems, Inc. is the initial license steward
and may publish revised and/or new versions of this License from time
to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.
Except as provided in Section 4.3, no one other than the license
steward has the right to modify this License.

4.2. Effect of New
Versions.
You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make
the Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the
License under which You originally received the Covered Software. If
the Initial Developer includes a notice in the Original Software
prohibiting it from being distributed or otherwise made available
under any subsequent version of the License, You must distribute and
make the Covered Software available under the terms of the version of
the License under which You originally received the Covered Software.
Otherwise, You may also choose to use, distribute or otherwise make
the Covered Software available under the terms of any subsequent
version of the License published by the license steward.

4.3.
Modified Versions.
When You are an Initial Developer and You want to
create a new license for Your Original Software, You may create and
use a modified version of this License if You: (a) rename the license
and remove any references to the name of the license steward (except
to note that the license differs from this License); and (b) otherwise
make it clear that the license contains terms which differ from this
License.

SHOULD ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT
THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY
NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY
CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED
SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

6.
TERMINATION.

6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will
terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and
fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the
breach. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect
beyond the termination of this License shall survive.

6.2. If You
assert a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment
actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial
Developer or Contributor against whom You assert such claim is
referred to as “Participant”) alleging that the Participant
Software (meaning the Contributor Version where the Participant is a
Contributor or the Original Software where the Participant is the
Initial Developer) directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then
any and all rights granted directly or indirectly to You by such
Participant, the Initial Developer (if the Initial Developer is not
the Participant) and all Contributors under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of
this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate
prospectively and automatically at the expiration of such 60 day
notice period, unless if within such 60 day period You withdraw Your
claim with respect to the Participant Software against such
Participant either unilaterally or pursuant to a written agreement
with Participant.

6.3. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1
or 6.2 above, all end user licenses that have been validly granted by
You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination (excluding
licenses granted to You by any distributor) shall survive
termination.

7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND
UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT,
OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR,

PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL,
INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING,
WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK

License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed
only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License
shall be governed by the law of the jurisdiction specified in a notice
contained within the Original Software (except to the extent
applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding such
jurisdiction’s conflict-of-law provisions. Any litigation relating
to this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the courts
located in the jurisdiction and venue specified in a notice contained
within the Original Software, with the losing party responsible for
costs, including, without limitation, court costs and reasonable
attorneys’ fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations
Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is
expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the
language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall
not apply to this License. You agree that You alone are responsible
for compliance with the United States export administration
regulations (and the export control laws and regulation of any other
countries) when You use, distribute or otherwise make available any
Covered Software.

10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.

As between Initial
Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible for claims
and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of
rights under this License and You agree to work with Initial Developer
and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable
basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any
admission of liability.

right to modify this License.

4.2. Effect of New Versions.
You may
always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered
Software available under the terms of the version of the License under
which You originally received the Covered Software. If the Initial
Developer includes a notice in the Original Software prohibiting it
from being distributed or otherwise made available under any
subsequent version of the License, You must distribute and make the
Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the
License under which You originally received the Covered Software.
Otherwise, You may also choose to use, distribute or otherwise make
the Covered Software available under the terms of any subsequent
version of the License published by the license steward.

4.3.
Modified Versions.
When You are an Initial Developer and You want to
create a new license for Your Original Software, You may create and

NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY
CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED
SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

6.
TERMINATION.

6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will
terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and

breach. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect
beyond the termination of this License shall survive.

6.2. If You
assert a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment
actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial
Developer or Contributor against whom You assert such claim is
referred to as “Participant”) alleging that the Participant
Software (meaning the Contributor Version where the Participant is a
Contributor or the Original Software where the Participant is the
Initial Developer) directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then
any and all rights granted directly or indirectly to You by such
Participant, the Initial Developer (if the Initial Developer is not
the Participant) and all Contributors under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of
this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate
prospectively and automatically at the expiration of such 60 day
notice period, unless if within such 60 day period You withdraw Your
claim with respect to the Participant Software against such
Participant either unilaterally or pursuant to a written agreement
with Participant.

6.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim
against Participant alleging that the Participant Software directly or
indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as
by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent
infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses
granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken
into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or
license.

6.4. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2
above, all end user licenses that have been validly granted by You or
any distributor hereunder prior to termination (excluding licenses
granted to You by any distributor) shall survive termination.

7.
LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

propriété intellectuelle et de la protection qu’il offre aux
auteurs et titulaires des droits patrimoniaux sur un
logiciel.
	•	d’autre part, le respect des principes de diffusion
des logiciels libres: accès au code source, droits étendus
conférés aux utilisateurs.

Les auteurs de la licence CeCILL1
sont:

Commissariat à l’Energie Atomique – CEA, établissement
public de caractère scientifique technique et industriel, dont le
siège est situé 31-33 rue de la Fédération, 75752 PARIS cedex

PREAMBULE

Ce contrat
est une licence de logiciel libre dont l'objectif est de conférer aux
utilisateurs la liberté de modification et de redistribution du
logiciel régi par cette licence dans le cadre d'un modèle de
diffusion «open source».

L'exercice de ces libertés est assorti de
certains devoirs à la charge des utilisateurs afin de préserver ce
statut au cours des redistributions ultérieures.

L’accessibilité
au code source et les droits de copie, de modification et de
redistribution qui en découlent ont pour contrepartie de n’offrir
aux utilisateurs qu’une garantie limitée et de ne faire peser sur
l’auteur du logiciel, le titulaire des droits patrimoniaux et les
concédants successifs qu’une responsabilité restreinte.

A cet
égard l’attention de l’utilisateur est attirée sur les risques
associés au chargement, à l’utilisation, à la modification et/ou
au développement et à la reproduction du logiciel par
l’utilisateur étant donné sa spécificité de logiciel libre, qui
peut le rendre complexe à manipuler et qui le réserve donc à des
développeurs et des professionnels avertis possédant des
connaissances informatiques approfondies. Les utilisateurs sont donc
invités à charger et tester l’adéquation du Logiciel à leurs
besoins dans des conditions permettant d'assurer la sécurité de
leurs systèmes et ou de leurs données et, plus généralement, à
l'utiliser et l'exploiter dans les même conditions de sécurité. Ce
contrat peut être reproduit et diffusé librement, sous réserve de
le conserver en l’état, sans ajout ni suppression de clauses.

Ce
contrat est susceptible de s’appliquer à tout logiciel dont le
titulaire des droits patrimoniaux décide de soumettre
l’exploitation aux dispositions qu’il contient.

PREAMBLE

The purpose of this Free Software Licensing Agreement is
to grant users the right to modify and redistribute the software
governed by this license within the framework of an ""open source""
distribution model.

The exercising of these rights is conditional
upon certain obligations for users so as to ensure that this status is
retained for subsequent redistribution operations.

As a counterpart
to the access to the source code and rights to copy, modify and
redistribute granted by the license, users are provided only with a
limited warranty and the software's author, the holder of the economic
rights, and the successive licensors only have limited liability.

In
this respect, it is brought to the user's attention that the risks
associated with loading, using, modifying and/or developing or
reproducing the software by the user given its nature of Free
Software, that may mean that it is complicated to manipulate, and that
also therefore means that it is reserved for developers and
experienced professionals having in-depth computer knowledge. Users
are therefore encouraged to load and test the Software's suitability
as regards their requirements in conditions enabling the security of
their systems and/or data to be ensured and, more generally, to use
and operate it in the same conditions of security. This Agreement may
be freely reproduced and published, provided it is not altered, and
that no Articles are either added or removed herefrom.

Avertissement

Ce contrat
est une licence de logiciel libre issue d'une concertation entre ses
auteurs afin que le respect de deux grands principes préside à sa
rédaction:

d'une part, le respect des principes de diffusion des
logiciels libres: accès au code source, droits étendus conférés
aux utilisateurs,
d'autre part, la désignation d'un droit applicable,
le droit français, auquel elle est conforme, tant au regard du droit
de la responsabilité civile que du droit de la propriété
intellectuelle et de la protection qu'il offre aux auteurs et
titulaires des droits patrimoniaux sur un logiciel.
Les auteurs de la
licence CeCILL1 sont:

Commissariat à l'Energie Atomique - CEA,
établissement public de recherche à caractère scientifique,
technique et industriel, dont le siège est situé 25 rue Leblanc,
immeuble Le Ponant D, 75015 Paris.

Centre National de la Recherche
Scientifique - CNRS, établissement public à caractère scientifique
et technologique, dont le siège est situé 3 rue Michel-Ange, 75794
Paris cedex 16.

Préambule

Ce contrat
est une licence de logiciel libre dont l'objectif est de conférer aux
utilisateurs la liberté de modification et de redistribution du
logiciel régi par cette licence dans le cadre d'un modèle de
diffusion en logiciel libre.

L'exercice de ces libertés est assorti
de certains devoirs à la charge des utilisateurs afin de préserver
ce statut au cours des redistributions ultérieures.

L'accessibilité
au code source et les droits de copie, de modification et de
redistribution qui en découlent ont pour contrepartie de n'offrir aux
utilisateurs qu'une garantie limitée et de ne faire peser sur
l'auteur du logiciel, le titulaire des droits patrimoniaux et les
concédants successifs qu'une responsabilité restreinte.

A cet
égard l'attention de l'utilisateur est attirée sur les risques
associés au chargement, à l'utilisation, à la modification et/ou au
développement et à la reproduction du logiciel par l'utilisateur
étant donné sa spécificité de logiciel libre, qui peut le rendre
complexe à manipuler et qui le réserve donc à des développeurs ou
des professionnels avertis possédant des connaissances informatiques
approfondies. Les utilisateurs sont donc invités à charger et tester
l'adéquation du logiciel à leurs besoins dans des conditions
permettant d'assurer la sécurité de leurs systèmes et/ou de leurs
données et, plus généralement, à l'utiliser et l'exploiter dans
les mêmes conditions de sécurité. Ce contrat peut être reproduit
et diffusé librement, sous réserve de le conserver en l'état, sans
ajout ni suppression de clauses.

Ce contrat est susceptible de
s'appliquer à tout logiciel dont le titulaire des droits patrimoniaux
décide de soumettre l'exploitation aux dispositions qu'il
contient.

d'en vérifier toutes les utilisations ni de détecter l'existence
d'éventuels défauts. L'attention du Licencié a été attirée sur
ce point sur les risques associés au chargement, à l'utilisation, la
modification et/ou au développement et à la reproduction du Logiciel
qui sont réservés à des utilisateurs avertis.

Il relève de la
responsabilité du Licencié de contrôler, par tous moyens,
l'adéquation du produit à ses besoins, son bon fonctionnement et de
s'assurer qu'il ne causera pas de dommages aux personnes et aux
biens.

9.2 Le Concédant déclare de bonne foi être en droit de
concéder l'ensemble des droits attachés au Logiciel (comprenant
notamment les droits visés à l'article 5).

9.3 Le Licencié
reconnaît que le Logiciel est fourni ""en l'état"" par le Concédant
sans autre garantie, expresse ou tacite, que celle prévue à
l'article 9.2 et notamment sans aucune garantie sur sa valeur
commerciale, son caractère sécurisé, innovant ou pertinent.

En
particulier, le Concédant ne garantit pas que le Logiciel est exempt
d'erreur, qu'il fonctionnera sans interruption, qu'il sera compatible
avec l'équipement du Licencié et sa configuration logicielle ni
qu'il remplira les besoins du Licencié.

9.4 Le Concédant ne
garantit pas, de manière expresse ou tacite, que le Logiciel ne porte
pas atteinte à un quelconque droit de propriété intellectuelle d'un
tiers portant sur un brevet, un logiciel ou sur tout autre droit de
propriété. Ainsi, le Concédant exclut toute garantie au profit du
Licencié contre les actions en contrefaçon qui pourraient être
diligentées au titre de l'utilisation, de la modification, et de la
redistribution du Logiciel. Néanmoins, si de telles actions sont
exercées contre le Licencié, le Concédant lui apportera son aide
technique et juridique pour sa défense. Cette aide technique et
juridique est déterminée au cas par cas entre le Concédant
concerné et le Licencié dans le cadre d'un protocole d'accord. Le
Concédant dégage toute responsabilité quant à l'utilisation de la
dénomination du Logiciel par le Licencié. Aucune garantie n'est
apportée quant à l'existence de droits antérieurs sur le nom du
Logiciel et sur l'existence d'une marque.

Contributeurs. 

 Article 7 - SERVICES ASSOCIES

7.1 Le Contrat
n'oblige en aucun cas le Concédant à la réalisation de prestations
d'assistance technique ou de maintenance du Logiciel.

Cependant le
Concédant reste libre de proposer ce type de services. Les termes et
conditions d'une telle assistance technique et/ou d'une telle
maintenance seront alors déterminés dans un acte séparé. Ces actes
de maintenance et/ou assistance technique n'engageront que la seule
responsabilité du Concédant qui les propose.

7.2 De même, tout
Concédant est libre de proposer, sous sa seule responsabilité, à
ses licenciés une garantie, qui n'engagera que lui, lors de la
redistribution du Logiciel et/ou du Logiciel Modifié et ce, dans les
conditions qu'il souhaite. Cette garantie et les modalités
financières de son application feront l'objet d'un acte séparé
entre le Concédant et le Licencié. 

 Article 8 -
RESPONSABILITE

8.1 Sous réserve des dispositions de l'article 8.2
<#limite-responsabilite>, le Licencié a la faculté, sous réserve de
prouver la faute du Concédant concerné, de solliciter la réparation
du préjudice direct qu'il subirait du fait du Logiciel et dont il
apportera la preuve.

8.2 La responsabilité du Concédant est
limitée aux engagements pris en application du Contrat et ne saurait
être engagée en raison notamment: (i) des dommages dus à
l'inexécution, totale ou partielle, de ses obligations par le
Licencié, (ii) des dommages directs ou indirects découlant de
l'utilisation ou des performances du Logiciel subis par le Licencié
et (iii) plus généralement d'un quelconque dommage indirect. En
particulier, les Parties conviennent expressément que tout préjudice
financier ou commercial (par exemple perte de données, perte de
bénéfices, perte d'exploitation, perte de clientèle ou de
commandes, manque à gagner, trouble commercial quelconque) ou toute
action dirigée contre le Licencié par un tiers, constitue un dommage
indirect et n'ouvre pas droit à réparation par le Concédant. 


Article 9 - GARANTIE

9.1 Le Licencié reconnaît que l'état actuel
des connaissances scientifiques et techniques au moment de la mise en
circulation du Logiciel ne permet pas d'en tester et d'en vérifier
toutes les utilisations ni de détecter l'existence d'éventuels
défauts. L'attention du Licencié a été attirée sur ce point sur
les risques associés au chargement, à l'utilisation, la modification
et/ou au développement et à la reproduction du Logiciel qui sont
réservés à des utilisateurs avertis.

Il relève de la
responsabilité du Licencié de contrôler, par tous moyens,
l'adéquation du produit à ses besoins, son bon fonctionnement et de
s'assurer qu'il ne causera pas de dommages aux personnes et aux
biens.

9.2 Le Concédant déclare de bonne foi être en droit de
concéder l'ensemble des droits attachés au Logiciel (comprenant
notamment les droits visés à l'article 5 <#etendue>).

9.3 Le
Licencié reconnaît que le Logiciel est fourni ""en l'état"" par le
Concédant sans autre garantie, expresse ou tacite, que celle prévue
à l'article 9.2 <#bonne-foi> et notamment sans aucune garantie sur sa
valeur commerciale, son caractère sécurisé, innovant ou
pertinent.

En particulier, le Concédant ne garantit pas que le
Logiciel est exempt d'erreur, qu'il fonctionnera sans interruption,
qu'il sera compatible avec l'équipement du Licencié et sa
configuration logicielle ni qu'il remplira les besoins du
Licencié.

9.4 Le Concédant ne garantit pas, de manière expresse ou
tacite, que le Logiciel ne porte pas atteinte à un quelconque droit
de propriété intellectuelle d'un tiers portant sur un brevet, un
logiciel ou sur tout autre droit de propriété. Ainsi, le Concédant
exclut toute garantie au profit du Licencié contre les actions en
contrefaçon qui pourraient être diligentées au titre de
l'utilisation, de la modification, et de la redistribution du
Logiciel. Néanmoins, si de telles actions sont exercées contre le
Licencié, le Concédant lui apportera son expertise technique et
juridique pour sa défense. Cette expertise technique et juridique est
déterminée au cas par cas entre le Concédant concerné et le
Licencié dans le cadre d'un protocole d'accord. Le Concédant dégage
toute responsabilité quant à l'utilisation de la dénomination du
Logiciel par le Licencié. Aucune garantie n'est apportée quant à
l'existence de droits antérieurs sur le nom du Logiciel et sur
l'existence d'une marque. 

 Article 10 - RESILIATION

10.1 En cas de
manquement par le Licencié aux obligations mises à sa charge par le
Contrat, le Concédant pourra résilier de plein droit le Contrat
trente (30) jours après notification adressée au Licencié et
restée sans effet.

     *
d'autre part, la désignation d'un droit applicable, le droit
français, auquel elle est conforme, tant au regard du droit de la
responsabilité civile que du droit de la propriété intellectuelle
et de la protection qu'il offre aux auteurs et titulaires des droits
patrimoniaux sur un logiciel.

 Préambule

Ce
contrat est une licence de logiciel libre dont l'objectif est de
conférer aux utilisateurs la liberté de modification et de
redistribution du logiciel régi par cette licence dans le cadre d'un
modèle de diffusion en logiciel libre.

L'exercice de ces libertés
est assorti de certains devoirs à la charge des utilisateurs afin de
préserver ce statut au cours des redistributions
ultérieures.

L'accessibilité au code source et les droits de copie,
de modification et de redistribution qui en découlent ont pour
contrepartie de n'offrir aux utilisateurs qu'une garantie limitée et
de ne faire peser sur l'auteur du logiciel, le titulaire des droits
patrimoniaux et les concédants successifs qu'une responsabilité
restreinte.

A cet égard l'attention de l'utilisateur est attirée
sur les risques associés au chargement, à l'utilisation, à la
modification et/ou au développement et à la reproduction du logiciel
par l'utilisateur étant donné sa spécificité de logiciel libre,
qui peut le rendre complexe à manipuler et qui le réserve donc à
des développeurs ou des professionnels avertis possédant des
connaissances informatiques approfondies. Les utilisateurs sont donc
invités à charger et tester l'adéquation du logiciel à leurs
besoins dans des conditions permettant d'assurer la sécurité de
leurs systèmes et/ou de leurs données et, plus généralement, à
l'utiliser et l'exploiter dans les mêmes conditions de sécurité. Ce
contrat peut être reproduit et diffusé librement, sous réserve de
le conserver en l'état, sans ajout ni suppression de clauses.

Ce
contrat est susceptible de s'appliquer à tout logiciel dont le
titulaire des droits patrimoniaux décide de soumettre l'exploitation
aux dispositions qu'il contient.

Préambule

Ce contrat
est une licence de logiciel libre dont l'objectif est de conférer aux
utilisateurs une très large liberté de modification et de
redistribution du logiciel régi par cette licence.

L'exercice de
cette liberté est assorti d'une obligation forte de citation à la
charge de ceux qui distribueraient un logiciel incorporant un logiciel
régi par la présente licence afin d'assurer que les contributions de
tous soient correctement identifiées et reconnues.

L'accessibilité
au code source et les droits de copie, de modification et de
redistribution qui découlent de ce contrat ont pour contrepartie de
n'offrir aux utilisateurs qu'une garantie limitée et de ne faire
peser sur l'auteur du logiciel, le titulaire des droits patrimoniaux
et les concédants successifs qu'une responsabilité restreinte.

A
cet égard l'attention de l'utilisateur est attirée sur les risques
associés au chargement, à l'utilisation, à la modification et/ou au
développement et à la reproduction du logiciel par l'utilisateur
étant donné sa spécificité de logiciel libre, qui peut le rendre
complexe à manipuler et qui le réserve donc à des développeurs ou
des professionnels avertis possédant des connaissances informatiques
approfondies. Les utilisateurs sont donc invités à charger et tester
l'adéquation du logiciel à leurs besoins dans des conditions
permettant d'assurer la sécurité de leurs systèmes et/ou de leurs
données et, plus généralement, à l'utiliser et l'exploiter dans
les mêmes conditions de sécurité. Ce contrat peut être reproduit
et diffusé librement, sous réserve de le conserver en l'état, sans

sans autre garantie, expresse ou tacite, que celle prévue à
l'article 9.2 et notamment sans aucune garantie sur sa valeur
commerciale, son caractère sécurisé, innovant ou pertinent.

En
particulier, le Concédant ne garantit pas que le Logiciel est exempt
d'erreur, qu'il fonctionnera sans interruption, qu'il sera compatible
avec l'équipement du Licencié et sa configuration logicielle ni
qu'il remplira les besoins du Licencié.

9.4 Le Concédant ne
garantit pas, de manière expresse ou tacite, que le Logiciel ne porte
pas atteinte à un quelconque droit de propriété intellectuelle d'un
tiers portant sur un brevet, un logiciel ou sur tout autre droit de
propriété. Ainsi, le Concédant exclut toute garantie au profit du
Licencié contre les actions en contrefaçon qui pourraient être
diligentées au titre de l'utilisation, de la modification, et de la
redistribution du Logiciel. Néanmoins, si de telles actions sont
exercées contre le Licencié, le Concédant lui apportera son aide
technique et juridique pour sa défense. Cette aide technique et
juridique est déterminée au cas par cas entre le Concédant
concerné et le Licencié dans le cadre d'un protocole d'accord. Le
Concédant dégage toute responsabilité quant à l'utilisation de la
dénomination du Logiciel par le Licencié. Aucune garantie n'est
apportée quant à l'existence de droits antérieurs sur le nom du
Logiciel et sur l'existence d'une marque.

Article 10 -

Avertissement

Ce
contrat est une licence de logiciel libre issue d'une concertation
entre ses auteurs afin que le respect de deux grands principes
préside à sa rédaction:

d'une part, le respect des principes de
diffusion des logiciels libres: accès au code source, droits étendus
conférés aux utilisateurs,
d'autre part, la désignation d'un droit
applicable, le droit français, auquel elle est conforme, tant au
regard du droit de la responsabilité civile que du droit de la
propriété intellectuelle et de la protection qu'il offre aux auteurs
et titulaires des droits patrimoniaux sur un logiciel.
Les auteurs de
la licence CeCILL-C1 sont:

Commissariat à l'Energie Atomique - CEA,
établissement public de recherche à caractère scientifique,
technique et industriel, dont le siège est situé 25 rue Leblanc,
immeuble Le Ponant D, 75015 Paris.

Centre National de la Recherche
Scientifique - CNRS, établissement public à caractère scientifique
et technologique, dont le siège est situé 3 rue Michel-Ange, 75794

Préambule

Ce contrat
est une licence de logiciel libre dont l'objectif est de conférer aux
utilisateurs la liberté de modifier et de réutiliser le logiciel
régi par cette licence.

L'exercice de cette liberté est assorti
d'une obligation de remettre à la disposition de la communauté les
modifications apportées au code source du logiciel afin de contribuer
à son évolution.

L'accessibilité au code source et les droits de
copie, de modification et de redistribution qui découlent de ce
contrat ont pour contrepartie de n'offrir aux utilisateurs qu'une
garantie limitée et de ne faire peser sur l'auteur du logiciel, le
titulaire des droits patrimoniaux et les concédants successifs qu'une
responsabilité restreinte.

A cet égard l'attention de l'utilisateur
est attirée sur les risques associés au chargement, à
l'utilisation, à la modification et/ou au développement et à la
reproduction du logiciel par l'utilisateur étant donné sa
spécificité de logiciel libre, qui peut le rendre complexe à
manipuler et qui le réserve donc à des développeurs ou des
professionnels avertis possédant des connaissances informatiques
approfondies. Les utilisateurs sont donc invités à charger et tester
l'adéquation du logiciel à leurs besoins dans des conditions
permettant d'assurer la sécurité de leurs systèmes et/ou de leurs
données et, plus généralement, à l'utiliser et l'exploiter dans
les mêmes conditions de sécurité. Ce contrat peut être reproduit
et diffusé librement, sous réserve de le conserver en l'état, sans
ajout ni suppression de clauses.

Ce contrat est susceptible de
s'appliquer à tout logiciel dont le titulaire des droits patrimoniaux
décide de soumettre l'exploitation aux dispositions qu'il
contient.

THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS
PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS COMMON PUBLIC LICENSE (""AGREEMENT"").
ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES
RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.

1.
DEFINITIONS

""Contribution"" means:

     a) in the case of the initial
Contributor, the initial code and documentation distributed under this
Agreement, and

     b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:

 
        i) changes to the Program, and

          ii) additions to the
Program;

where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate
from and are distributed by that particular Contributor. A
Contribution 'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to the
Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such
Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the
Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in
conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and
(ii) are not derivative works of the Program.

""Contributor"" means any
person or entity that distributes the Program.

""Licensed Patents ""
mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are necessarily
infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when
combined with the Program.

""Program"" means the Contributions
distributed in accordance with this Agreement.

""Recipient"" means
anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, including all
Contributors.

2. GRANT OF RIGHTS

     a) Subject to the terms of
this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a
non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce,
prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform,
distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if
any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form.


    b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent
license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,
import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if
any, in source code and object code form. This patent license shall
apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at
the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition
of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the
Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other
combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is
licensed hereunder.

     c) Recipient understands that although each
Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein,
no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does
not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any
other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient
for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of
intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to
exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient
hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual
property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent
license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it
is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before
distributing the Program.

     d) Each Contributor represents that to
its knowledge it has sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution,
if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in this
Agreement.

3. REQUIREMENTS

A Contributor may choose to distribute
the Program in object code form under its own license agreement,
provided that:

     a) it complies with the terms and conditions of
this Agreement; and

     b) its license agreement:

          i)
effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and
conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of
title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of
merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;

          ii)
effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for
damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and
consequential damages, such as lost profits;

          iii) states
that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by
that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and

          iv)
states that source code for the Program is available from such
Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable
manner on or through a medium customarily used for software
exchange.

When the Program is made available in source code form:

  
  a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and

     b) a
copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the
Program.

Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices
contained within the Program.

Each Contributor must identify itself
as the originator of its Contribution, if any, in a manner that
reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of
the Contribution.

4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION

Commercial distributors
of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end
users, business partners and the like. While this license is intended
to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who
includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in
a manner which does not create potential liability for other
Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a
commercial product offering, such Contributor (""Commercial
Contributor"") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other
Contributor (""Indemnified Contributor"") against any losses, damages
and costs (collectively ""Losses"") arising from claims, lawsuits and
other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified
Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such
Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the
Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this
section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or
alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an
Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial
Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial
Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor
in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The
Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own
expense.

For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a
commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a
Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes
performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those
performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's
responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor
would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to
those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any
other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial
Contributor must pay those damages.

5. NO WARRANTY

EXCEPT AS
EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN
""AS IS"" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR
CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR
A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for
determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program
and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under
this Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and costs of
program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of
data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of
operations.

6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH
IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE
ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,
EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST
PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN
CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR
OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE
PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF
ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. GENERAL

If any
provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further
action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the
minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and
enforceable.

If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a
Contributor with respect to a patent applicable to software (including
a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit), then any patent licenses
granted by that Contributor to such Recipient under this Agreement
shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. In addition,
if Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other
software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such
Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of
the date such litigation is filed.

All Recipient's rights under this
Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the
material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such
failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such
noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement
terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the
Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's
obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient
relating to the Program shall continue and survive.

Everyone is
permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in
order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only
be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves
the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this
Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward
has the right to modify this Agreement. IBM is the initial Agreement
Steward. IBM may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement
Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the
Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program
(including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the
version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition,
after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may
elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under
the new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b)
above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual
property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly,
by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not
expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.

This Agreement
is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the intellectual
property laws of the United States of America. No party to this
Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one
year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to
a jury trial in any resulting litigation.

Preamble

The intent of this document
is to state the conditions under which a Package may be copied, such
that the Copyright Holder maintains some semblance of artistic control
over the development of the package, while giving the users of the
package the right to use and distribute the Package in a more-or-less
customary fashion, plus the right to make reasonable
modifications.

Definitions:

 ""Package"" refers to the collection of
files distributed by the Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that
collection of files created through textual modification.

 ""Standard
Version"" refers to such a Package if it has not been modified, or has
been modified in accordance with the wishes of the Copyright Holder as
specified below.

 ""Copyright Holder"" is whoever is named in the
copyright or copyrights for the package.

 ""You"" is you, if you're
thinking about copying or distributing this Package.

 ""Distribution
fee"" is a fee you charge for providing a copy of this Package to
another party.

 ""Freely Available"" means that no fee is charged for
the right to use the item, though there may be fees involved in
handling the item. It also means that recipients of the item may
redistribute it under the same conditions they received it.

1. You
may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the
Standard Version of this Package without restriction, provided that
you duplicate all of the original copyright notices and associated
disclaimers.

2. You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other
modifications derived from the Public Domain, or those made Freely
Available, or from the Copyright Holder. A Package modified in such a
way shall still be considered the Standard Version.

3. You may
otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way, provided that
you insert a prominent notice in each changed file stating how and
when you changed that file, and provided that you do at least ONE of
the following:

     a) place your modifications in the Public Domain
or otherwise make them Freely Available, such as by posting said
modifications to Usenet or an equivalent medium, or placing the
modifications on a major network archive site allowing unrestricted
access to them, or by allowing the Copyright Holder to include your
modifications in the Standard Version of the Package.

     b) use the
modified Package only within your corporation or organization.

    
c) rename any non-standard executables so the names do not conflict
with standard executables, which must also be provided, and provide a
separate manual page for each non-standard executable that clearly
documents how it differs from the Standard Version.

     d) make
other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.

     e)
permit and encourge anyone who receives a copy of the modified Package
permission to make your modifications Freely Available in some
specific way. 

4. You may distribute the programs of this Package in
object code or executable form, provided that you do at least ONE of
the following:

     a) distribute a Standard Version of the
executables and library files, together with instructions (in the
manual page or equivalent) on where to get the Standard Version.

    
b) accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of the
Package with your modifications.

     c) give non-standard
executables non-standard names, and clearly document the differences
in manual pages (or equivalent), together with instructions on where
to get the Standard Version.

     d) make other distribution
arrangements with the Copyright Holder.

     e) offer the
machine-readable source of the Package, with your modifications, by
mail order.

5. You may charge a distribution fee for any distribution
of this Package. If you offer support for this Package, you may charge
any fee you choose for that support. You may not charge a license fee
for the right to use this Package itself. You may distribute this
Package in aggregate with other (possibly commercial and possibly
nonfree) programs as part of a larger (possibly commercial and
possibly nonfree) software distribution, and charge license fees for
other parts of that software distribution, provided that you do not
advertise this Package as a product of your own. If the Package
includes an interpreter, You may embed this Package's interpreter
within an executable of yours (by linking); this shall be construed as
a mere form of aggregation, provided that the complete Standard
Version of the interpreter is so embedded.

6. The scripts and library
files supplied as input to or produced as output from the programs of
this Package do not automatically fall under the copyright of this
Package, but belong to whoever generated them, and may be sold
commercially, and may be aggregated with this Package. If such scripts
or library files are aggregated with this Package via the so-called
""undump"" or ""unexec"" methods of producing a binary executable image,
then distribution of such an image shall neither be construed as a
distribution of this Package nor shall it fall under the restrictions
of Paragraphs 3 and 4, provided that you do not represent such an
executable image as a Standard Version of this Package.

7. C
subroutines (or comparably compiled subroutines in other languages)
supplied by you and linked into this Package in order to emulate
subroutines and variables of the language defined by this Package
shall not be considered part of this Package, but are the equivalent
of input as in Paragraph 6, provided these subroutines do not change
the language in any way that would cause it to fail the regression
tests for the language.

8. Aggregation of the Standard Version of the
Package with a commercial distribution is always permitted provided
that the use of this Package is embedded; that is, when no overt
attempt is made to make this Package's interfaces visible to the end
user of the commercial distribution. Such use shall not be construed
as a distribution of this Package.

9. The name of the Copyright
Holder may not be used to endorse or promote products derived from
this software without specific prior written permission.

10. THIS
PACKAGE IS PROVIDED ""AS IS"" AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED
WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTIBILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

include this copyright statement along with any code built using DOC

if you just ship binary executables of your software products.

You
can use DOC software in commercial and/or binary software releases and
are under no obligation to redistribute any of your source code that
is built using DOC software. Note, however, that you may not
misappropriate the DOC software code, such as copyrighting it yourself
or claiming authorship of the DOC software code, in a way that will
prevent DOC software from being distributed freely using an
open-source development model. You needn't inform anyone that you're

stories.

daylight savings times (DST) rules for the United States that expand
DST as of March 2007. Since DOC software obtains time/date and

THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED
UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE PUBLIC LICENSE (""AGREEMENT""). ANY USE,
REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S
ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.

1. DEFINITIONS

""Contribution"" means:
 
   a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and
documentation distributed under this Agreement, and
     b) in the
case of each subsequent Contributor:
          i) changes to the
Program, and
          ii) additions to the Program;

where such
changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are
distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution
'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such
Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf.
Contributions do not include additions to the Program which: (i) are
separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with the
Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative
works of the Program.
""Contributor"" means any person or entity that
distributes the Program.

""Licensed Patents"" mean patent claims
licensable by a Contributor which are necessarily infringed by the use
or sale of its Contribution alone or when combined with the
Program.

""Program"" means the Contributions distributed in accordance
with this Agreement.

""Recipient"" means anyone who receives the
Program under this Agreement, including all Contributors.

2. GRANT OF
RIGHTS

     a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each
Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide,
royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works
of, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the
Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative works,
in source code and object code form.
 
     b) Subject to the terms of
this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a
non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed
Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise
transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code
and object code form. This patent license shall apply to the
combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the
Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the
Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed
Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations
which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed
hereunder.

     c) Recipient understands that although each
Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein,
no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does
not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any
other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient
for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of
intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to
exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient
hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual
property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent
license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it
is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before
distributing the Program.

     d) Each Contributor represents that to
its knowledge it has sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution,
if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in this
Agreement.

3. REQUIREMENTS
A Contributor may choose to distribute the
Program in object code form under its own license agreement, provided
that:

     a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this
Agreement; and
 
     b) its license agreement:
          i)
effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and
conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of
title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of
merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;
          ii)
effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for
damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and
consequential damages, such as lost profits;
          iii) states
that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by
that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and
          iv)
states that source code for the Program is available from such
Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable
manner on or through a medium customarily used for software
exchange.

When the Program is made available in source code form:

  
  a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and

     b) a
copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the
Program.
Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices
contained within the Program.

Each Contributor must identify itself
as the originator of its Contribution, if any, in a manner that
reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of
the Contribution.

4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
Commercial distributors
of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end
users, business partners and the like. While this license is intended
to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who
includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in
a manner which does not create potential liability for other
Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a
commercial product offering, such Contributor (""Commercial
Contributor"") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other
Contributor (""Indemnified Contributor"") against any losses, damages
and costs (collectively ""Losses"") arising from claims, lawsuits and
other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified
Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such
Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the
Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this
section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or
alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an
Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial
Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial
Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor
in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The
Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own
expense.

For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a
commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a
Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes
performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those
performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's
responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor
would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to
those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any
other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial
Contributor must pay those damages.

5. NO WARRANTY
EXCEPT AS
EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN
""AS IS"" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR
CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR
A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for
determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program
and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under
this Agreement , including but not limited to the risks and costs of
program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of
data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of
operations.

6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH
IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE
ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,
EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST
PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN
CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR
OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE
PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF
ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. GENERAL

If any
provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further
action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the
minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and
enforceable.

If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any
entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging
that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with
other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then
such Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as
of the date such litigation is filed.

All Recipient's rights under
this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the
material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such
failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such
noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement
terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the
Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's
obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient
relating to the Program shall continue and survive.

Everyone is
permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in
order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only
be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves
the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this
Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward
has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the
initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the
responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable
separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a
distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions)
may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement
under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the
Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the
Program (including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as
expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives
no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor
under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or
otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this
Agreement are reserved.

This Agreement is governed by the laws of the
State of New York and the intellectual property laws of the United
States of America. No party to this Agreement will bring a legal
action under this Agreement more than one year after the cause of
action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in any
resulting litigation.

EUPL (c) the European Community
2007 

This European Union Public Licence (the “EUPL”) applies to
the Work or Software (as defined below) which is provided under the
terms of this Licence. Any use of the Work, other than as authorised
under this Licence is prohibited (to the extent such use is covered by
a right of the copyright holder of the Work). 

The Original Work is
provided under the terms of this Licence when the Licensor (as defined
below) has placed the following notice immediately following the
copyright notice for the Original Work: 

     Licensed under the EUPL
V.1.0 

or has expressed by any other mean his willingness to license
under the EUPL. 

1. Definitions

In this Licence, the following terms
have the following meaning: 

     − The Licence: this Licence. 

  
  − The Original Work or the Software: the software distributed
and/or communicated by the Licensor under this Licence, available as
Source Code and also as Executable Code as the case may be. 

     −
Derivative Works: the works or software that could be created by the
Licensee, based upon the Original Work or modifications thereof. This
Licence does not define the extent of modification or dependence on
the Original Work required in order to classify a work as a Derivative
Work; this extent is determined by copyright law applicable in the
country mentioned in Article 15. 

     − The Work: the Original
Work and/or its Derivative Works. 

     − The Source Code: the
human-readable form of the Work which is the most convenient for
people to study and modify. 

     − The Executable Code: any code
which has generally been compiled and which is meant to be interpreted
by a computer as a program. 

     − The Licensor: the natural or
legal person that distributes and/or communicates the Work under the
Licence. 

     − Contributor(s): any natural or legal person who
modifies the Work under the Licence, or otherwise contributes to the
creation of a Derivative Work. 

     − The Licensee or “You”:
any natural or legal person who makes any usage of the Software under
the terms of the Licence. − Distribution and/or Communication: any
act of selling, giving, lending, renting, distributing, communicating,
transmitting, or otherwise making available, on-line or off-line,
copies of the Work at the disposal of any other natural or legal
person. 

2. Scope of the rights granted by the Licence

The Licensor
hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive,
sub-licensable licence to do the following, for the duration of
copyright vested in the Original Work: 

     − use the Work in any
circumstance and for all usage, 
     
     − reproduce the Work, 
 
   
     − modify the Original Work, and make Derivative Works based
upon the Work, 
     
     − communicate to the public, including
the right to make available or display the Work or copies thereof to
the public and perform publicly, as the case may be, the Work, 

    
− distribute the Work or copies thereof, 

     − lend and rent
the Work or copies thereof, 

     − sub-license rights in the Work
or copies thereof. 

Those rights can be exercised on any media,
supports and formats, whether now known or later invented, as far as
the applicable law permits so. 

In the countries where moral rights
apply, the Licensor waives his right to exercise his moral right to
the extent allowed by law in order to make effective the licence of
the economic rights here above listed. 

The Licensor grants to the
Licensee royalty-free, non exclusive usage rights to any patents held
by the Licensor, to the extent necessary to make use of the rights
granted on the Work under this Licence. 

3. Communication of the
Source Code

The Licensor may provide the Work either in its Source
Code form, or as Executable Code. If the Work is provided as
Executable Code, the Licensor provides in addition a machinereadable
copy of the Source Code of the Work along with each copy of the Work
that the Licensor distributes or indicates, in a notice following the
copyright notice attached to the Work, a repository where the Source
Code is easily and freely accessible for as long as the Licensor
continues to distribute and/or communicate the Work. 

4. Limitations
on copyright

Nothing in this Licence is intended to deprive the
Licensee of the benefits from any exception or limitation to the
exclusive rights of the rights owners in the Original Work or
Software, of the exhaustion of those rights or of other applicable
limitations thereto. 

5. Obligations of the Licensee

The grant of
the rights mentioned above is subject to some restrictions and
obligations imposed on the Licensee. Those obligations are the
following: 

Attribution right: the Licensee shall keep intact all
copyright, patent or trademarks notices and all notices that refer to
the Licence and to the disclaimer of warranties. The Licensee must
include a copy of such notices and a copy of the Licence with every
copy of the Work he/she distributes and/or communicates. The Licensee
must cause any Derivative Work to carry prominent notices stating that
the Work has been modified and the date of modification. 

Copyleft
clause: If the Licensee distributes and/or communicates copies of the
Original Works or Derivative Works based upon the Original Work, this
Distribution and/or Communication will be done under the terms of this
Licence. The Licensee (becoming Licensor) cannot offer or impose any
additional terms or conditions on the Work or Derivative Work that
alter or restrict the terms of the Licence. 

Compatibility clause: If
the Licensee Distributes and/or Communicates Derivative Works or
copies thereof based upon both the Original Work and another work
licensed under a Compatible Licence, this Distribution and/or
Communication can be done under the terms of this Compatible Licence.
For the sake of this clause, “Compatible Licence” refers to the
licences listed in the appendix attached to this Licence. Should the
Licensee’s obligations under the Compatible Licence conflict with
his/her obligations under this Licence, the obligations of the
Compatible Licence shall prevail. 

Provision of Source Code: When
distributing and/or communicating copies of the Work, the Licensee
will provide a machine-readable copy of the Source Code or indicate a
repository where this Source will be easily and freely available for
as long as the Licensee continues to distribute and/or communicate the
Work. 

Legal Protection: This Licence does not grant permission to
use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or names of the
Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in
describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the
copyright notice. 

6. Chain of Authorship

The original Licensor
warrants that the copyright in the Original Work granted hereunder is
owned by him/her or licensed to him/her and that he/she has the power
and authority to grant the Licence. 

Each Contributor warrants that
the copyright in the modifications he/she brings to the Work are owned
by him/her or licensed to him/her and that he/she has the power and
authority to grant the Licence. 

Each time You, as a Licensee,
receive the Work, the original Licensor and subsequent Contributors
grant You a licence to their contributions to the Work, under the
terms of this Licence. 

7. Disclaimer of Warranty

The Work is a work
in progress, which is continuously improved by numerous contributors.
It is not a finished work and may therefore contain defects or
“bugs” inherent to this type of software development. 

For the
above reason, the Work is provided under the Licence on an “as is”
basis and without warranties of any kind concerning the Work,
including without limitation merchantability, fitness for a particular
purpose, absence of defects or errors, accuracy, non-infringement of
intellectual property rights other than copyright as stated in Article
6 of this Licence. 

This disclaimer of warranty is an essential part
of the Licence and a condition for the grant of any rights to the
Work. 

8. Disclaimer of Liability

Except in the cases of wilful
misconduct or damages directly caused to natural persons, the Licensor
will in no event be liable for any direct or indirect, material or
moral, damages of any kind, arising out of the Licence or of the use
of the Work, including without limitation, damages for loss of
goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, loss of data
or any commercial damage, even if the Licensor has been advised of the
possibility of such damage. However, the Licensor will be liable under
statutory product liability laws as far such laws apply to the Work.


9. Additional agreements

While distributing the Original Work or
Derivative Works, You may choose to conclude an additional agreement
to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty,
indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or services consistent
with this Licence. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act
only on your own behalf and on your sole responsibility, not on behalf
of the original Licensor or any other Contributor, and only if You
agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any
liability incurred by, or claims asserted against such Contributor by
the fact You have accepted any such warranty or additional liability.


10. Acceptance of the Licence

The provisions of this Licence can be
accepted by clicking on an icon “I agree” placed under the bottom
of a window displaying the text of this Licence or by affirming
consent in any other similar way, in accordance with the rules of
applicable law. Clicking on that icon indicates your clear and
irrevocable acceptance of this Licence and all of its terms and
conditions. 

Similarly, you irrevocably accept this Licence and all
of its terms and conditions by exercising any rights granted to You by
Article 2 of this Licence, such as the use of the Work, the creation
by You of a Derivative Work or the Distribution and/or Communication
by You of the Work or copies thereof. 

11. Information to the
public

In case of any Distribution and/or Communication of the Work
by means of electronic communication by You (for example, by offering
to download the Work from a remote location) the distribution channel
or media (for example, a website) must at least provide to the public
the information requested by the applicable law regarding the
identification and address of the Licensor, the Licence and the way it
may be accessible, concluded, stored and reproduced by the Licensee.


12. Termination of the Licence

The Licence and the rights granted
hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by the Licensee
of the terms of the Licence. 

Such a termination will not terminate
the licences of any person who has received the Work from the Licensee
under the Licence, provided such persons remain in full compliance
with the Licence. 

13. Miscellaneous

Without prejudice of Article 9
above, the Licence represents the complete agreement between the
Parties as to the Work licensed hereunder. 

If any provision of the
Licence is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, this will
not affect the validity or enforceability of the Licence as a whole.
Such provision will be construed and/or reformed so as necessary to
make it valid and enforceable. 

The European Commission may put into
force translations and/or binding new versions of this Licence, so far
this is required and reasonable. New versions of the Licence will be
published with a unique version number. The new version of the Licence
becomes binding for You as soon as You become aware of its
publication. 

14. Jurisdiction

Any litigation resulting from the
interpretation of this License, arising between the European
Commission, as a Licensor, and any Licensee, will be subject to the
jurisdiction of the Court of Justice of the European Communities, as
laid down in article 238 of the Treaty establishing the European
Community. 

Any litigation arising between Parties, other than the
European Commission, and resulting from the interpretation of this
License, will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the
competent court where the Licensor resides or conducts its primary
business. 

15. Applicable Law

This Licence shall be governed by the
law of the European Union country where the Licensor resides or has
his registered office. 

This licence shall be governed by the Belgian
law if: 

     − a litigation arises between the European
Commission, as a Licensor, and any Licensee; 

     − the Licensor,
other than the European Commission, has no residence or registered
office inside a European Union country.

EUPL (c) the European Community
2007

This European Union Public Licence (the ""EUPL"") applies to the
Work or Software (as defined below) which is provided under the terms
of this Licence. Any use of the Work, other than as authorised under
this Licence is prohibited (to the extent such use is covered by a
right of the copyright holder of the Work).

The Original Work is
provided under the terms of this Licence when the Licensor (as defined
below) has placed the following notice immediately following the
copyright notice for the Original Work: 

     Licensed under the EUPL
V.1.1 

or has expressed by any other mean his willingness to license
under the EUPL.

1. Definitions

In this Licence, the following terms
have the following meaning:

     - The Licence: this Licence.

     -
The Original Work or the Software: the software distributed and/or
communicated by the Licensor under this Licence, available as Source
Code and also as Executable Code as the case may be.

     -
Derivative Works: the works or software that could be created by the
Licensee, based upon the Original Work or modifications thereof. This
Licence does not define the extent of modification or dependence on
the Original Work required in order to classify a work as a Derivative
Work; this extent is determined by copyright law applicable in the
country mentioned in Article 15.

     - The Work: the Original Work
and/or its Derivative Works.

     - The Source Code: the
human-readable form of the Work which is the most convenient for
people to study and modify.

     - The Executable Code: any code
which has generally been compiled and which is meant to be interpreted
by a computer as a program.

     - The Licensor: the natural or legal
person that distributes and/or communicates the Work under the
Licence.

     - Contributor(s): any natural or legal person who
modifies the Work under the Licence, or otherwise contributes to the
creation of a Derivative Work.

     - The Licensee or ""You"": any
natural or legal person who makes any usage of the Software under the
terms of the Licence.

     - Distribution and/or Communication: any
act of selling, giving, lending, renting, distributing, communicating,
transmitting, or otherwise making available, on-line or off-line,
copies of the Work or providing access to its essential
functionalities at the disposal of any other natural or legal
person.

2. Scope of the rights granted by the Licence

The Licensor
hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive,
sublicensable licence to do the following, for the duration of
copyright vested in the Original Work:

     - use the Work in any
circumstance and for all usage, 

     - reproduce the Work, 

     -
modify the Original Work, and make Derivative Works based upon the
Work, 

     - communicate to the public, including the right to make
available or display the Work or copies thereof to the public and
perform publicly, as the case may be, the Work, 

     - distribute
the Work or copies thereof, 

     - lend and rent the Work or copies
thereof, 

     - sub-license rights in the Work or copies
thereof.

Those rights can be exercised on any media, supports and
formats, whether now known or later invented, as far as the applicable
law permits so.

In the countries where moral rights apply, the
Licensor waives his right to exercise his moral right to the extent
allowed by law in order to make effective the licence of the economic
rights here above listed.

The Licensor grants to the Licensee
royalty-free, non exclusive usage rights to any patents held by the
Licensor, to the extent necessary to make use of the rights granted on
the Work under this Licence.

3. Communication of the Source Code

The
Licensor may provide the Work either in its Source Code form, or as
Executable Code. If the Work is provided as Executable Code, the
Licensor provides in addition a machine-readable copy of the Source
Code of the Work along with each copy of the Work that the Licensor
distributes or indicates, in a notice following the copyright notice
attached to the Work, a repository where the Source Code is easily and
freely accessible for as long as the Licensor continues to distribute
and/or communicate the Work.

4. Limitations on copyright

Nothing in
this Licence is intended to deprive the Licensee of the benefits from
any exception or limitation to the exclusive rights of the rights
owners in the Original Work or Software, of the exhaustion of those
rights or of other applicable limitations thereto.

5. Obligations of
the Licensee

The grant of the rights mentioned above is subject to
some restrictions and obligations imposed on the Licensee. Those
obligations are the following:

Attribution right: the Licensee shall
keep intact all copyright, patent or trademarks notices and all
notices that refer to the Licence and to the disclaimer of warranties.
The Licensee must include a copy of such notices and a copy of the
Licence with every copy of the Work he/she distributes and/or
communicates. The Licensee must cause any Derivative Work to carry
prominent notices stating that the Work has been modified and the date
of modification.

Copyleft clause: If the Licensee distributes and/or
communicates copies of the Original Works or Derivative Works based
upon the Original Work, this Distribution and/or Communication will be
done under the terms of this Licence or of a later version of this
Licence unless the Original Work is expressly distributed only under
this version of the Licence. The Licensee (becoming Licensor) cannot
offer or impose any additional terms or conditions on the Work or
Derivative Work that alter or restrict the terms of the
Licence.

Compatibility clause: If the Licensee Distributes and/or
Communicates Derivative Works or copies thereof based upon both the
Original Work and another work licensed under a Compatible Licence,
this Distribution and/or Communication can be done under the terms of
this Compatible Licence. For the sake of this clause, ""Compatible
Licence,"" refers to the licences listed in the appendix attached to
this Licence. Should the Licensee's obligations under the Compatible
Licence conflict with his/her obligations under this Licence, the
obligations of the Compatible Licence shall prevail.

Provision of
Source Code: When distributing and/or communicating copies of the
Work, the Licensee will provide a machine-readable copy of the Source
Code or indicate a repository where this Source will be easily and
freely available for as long as the Licensee continues to distribute
and/or communicate the Work.

Legal Protection: This Licence does not
grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or
names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary
use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content
of the copyright notice.

6. Chain of Authorship

The original
Licensor warrants that the copyright in the Original Work granted
hereunder is owned by him/her or licensed to him/her and that he/she
has the power and authority to grant the Licence.

Each Contributor
warrants that the copyright in the modifications he/she brings to the
Work are owned by him/her or licensed to him/her and that he/she has
the power and authority to grant the Licence.

Each time You accept
the Licence, the original Licensor and subsequent Contributors grant
You a licence to their contributions to the Work, under the terms of
this Licence.

7. Disclaimer of Warranty

The Work is a work in
progress, which is continuously improved by numerous contributors. It
is not a finished work and may therefore contain defects or ""bugs""
inherent to this type of software development.

For the above reason,
the Work is provided under the Licence on an ""as is"" basis and without
warranties of any kind concerning the Work, including without
limitation merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, absence
of defects or errors, accuracy, non-infringement of intellectual
property rights other than copyright as stated in Article 6 of this
Licence.

This disclaimer of warranty is an essential part of the
Licence and a condition for the grant of any rights to the Work.

8.
Disclaimer of Liability

Except in the cases of wilful misconduct or
damages directly caused to natural persons, the Licensor will in no
event be liable for any direct or indirect, material or moral, damages
of any kind, arising out of the Licence or of the use of the Work,
including without limitation, damages for loss of goodwill, work
stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, loss of data or any
commercial damage, even if the Licensor has been advised of the
possibility of such damage. However, the Licensor will be liable under
statutory product liability laws as far such laws apply to the
Work.

9. Additional agreements

While distributing the Original Work
or Derivative Works, You may choose to conclude an additional
agreement to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support,
warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or services
consistent with this Licence. However, in accepting such obligations,
You may act only on your own behalf and on your sole responsibility,
not on behalf of the original Licensor or any other Contributor, and
only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor
harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against
such Contributor by the fact You have accepted any such warranty or
additional liability.

10. Acceptance of the Licence

The provisions
of this Licence can be accepted by clicking on an icon ""I agree""
placed under the bottom of a window displaying the text of this
Licence or by affirming consent in any other similar way, in
accordance with the rules of applicable law. Clicking on that icon
indicates your clear and irrevocable acceptance of this Licence and
all of its terms and conditions.

Similarly, you irrevocably accept
this Licence and all of its terms and conditions by exercising any
rights granted to You by Article 2 of this Licence, such as the use of
the Work, the creation by You of a Derivative Work or the Distribution
and/or Communication by You of the Work or copies thereof.

11.
Information to the public

In case of any Distribution and/or
Communication of the Work by means of electronic communication by You
(for example, by offering to download the Work from a remote location)
the distribution channel or media (for example, a website) must at
least provide to the public the information requested by the
applicable law regarding the Licensor, the Licence and the way it may
be accessible, concluded, stored and reproduced by the Licensee.

12.
Termination of the Licence

The Licence and the rights granted
hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by the Licensee
of the terms of the Licence. Such a termination will not terminate the
licences of any person who has received the Work from the Licensee
under the Licence, provided such persons remain in full compliance
with the Licence.

13. Miscellaneous

Without prejudice of Article 9
above, the Licence represents the complete agreement between the
Parties as to the Work licensed hereunder.

If any provision of the
Licence is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, this will
not affect the validity or enforceability of the Licence as a whole.
Such provision will be construed and/or reformed so as necessary to
make it valid and enforceable.

The European Commission may publish
other linguistic versions and/or new versions of this Licence, so far
this is required and reasonable, without reducing the scope of the
rights granted by the Licence. New versions of the Licence will be
published with a unique version number.

All linguistic versions of
this Licence, approved by the European Commission, have identical
value. Parties can take advantage of the linguistic version of their
choice.

14. Jurisdiction

Any litigation resulting from the
interpretation of this License, arising between the European
Commission, as a Licensor, and any Licensee, will be subject to the
jurisdiction of the Court of Justice of the European Communities, as
laid down in article 238 of the Treaty establishing the European
Community.

Any litigation arising between Parties, other than the
European Commission, and resulting from the interpretation of this
License, will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the
competent court where the Licensor resides or conducts its primary
business.

15. Applicable Law

This Licence shall be governed by the
law of the European Union country where the Licensor resides or has
his registered office.

This licence shall be governed by the Belgian
law if:

     - a litigation arises between the European Commission,
as a Licensor, and any Licensee; 

     - the Licensor, other than the
European Commission, has no residence or registered office inside a
European Union country.

Introduction


The FreeType Project is distributed in several archive packages;
some of them may contain, in addition to the FreeType font engine,
various tools and contributions which rely on, or relate to, the
FreeType Project.

This license applies to all files found in such
packages, and which do not fall under their own explicit license. The
license affects thus the FreeType font engine, the test programs,
documentation and makefiles, at the very least.

This license was
inspired by the BSD, Artistic, and IJG (Independent JPEG Group)
licenses, which all encourage inclusion and use of free software in
commercial and freeware products alike. As a consequence, its main
points are that:

     o We don't promise that this software works.
However, we will be interested in any kind of bug reports. (`as is'
distribution)

     o You can use this software for whatever you want,
in parts or full form, without having to pay us. (`royalty-free'
usage)

     o You may not pretend that you wrote this software. If
you use it, or only parts of it, in a program, you must acknowledge
somewhere in your documentation that you have used the FreeType code.
(`credits')

We specifically permit and encourage the inclusion of
this software, with or without modifications, in commercial products.
We disclaim all warranties covering The FreeType Project and assume no
liability related to The FreeType Project. 

Finally, many people
asked us for a preferred form for a credit/disclaimer to use in
compliance with this license. We thus encourage you to use the
following text:

     """""" Portions of this software are copyright ©
<year> The FreeType Project (www.freetype.org). All rights reserved.
""""""

Please replace <year> with the value from the FreeType version
you actually use. 

Legal Terms 

0. Definitions 

Throughout this
license, the terms `package', `FreeType Project', and `FreeType
archive' refer to the set of files originally distributed by the
authors (David Turner, Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg) as the
`FreeType Project', be they named as alpha, beta or final
release.

`You' refers to the licensee, or person using the project,
where `using' is a generic term including compiling the project's
source code as well as linking it to form a `program' or `executable'.
This program is referred to as `a program using the FreeType
engine'.

This license applies to all files distributed in the
original FreeType Project, including all source code, binaries and
documentation, unless otherwise stated in the file in its original,
unmodified form as distributed in the original archive. If you are
unsure whether or not a particular file is covered by this license,
you must contact us to verify this.

The FreeType Project is copyright
(C) 1996-2000 by David Turner, Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg. All
rights reserved except as specified below.

1. No Warranty 

THE
FREETYPE PROJECT IS PROVIDED `AS IS' WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, WARRANTIES
OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. IN NO EVENT
WILL ANY OF THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES
CAUSED BY THE USE OR THE INABILITY TO USE, OF THE FREETYPE
PROJECT.

2. Redistribution

This license grants a worldwide,
royalty-free, perpetual and irrevocable right and license to use,
execute, perform, compile, display, copy, create derivative works of,
distribute and sublicense the FreeType Project (in both source and
object code forms) and derivative works thereof for any purpose; and
to authorize others to exercise some or all of the rights granted
herein, subject to the following conditions:

     o Redistribution of
source code must retain this license file (`FTL.TXT') unaltered; any
additions, deletions or changes to the original files must be clearly
indicated in accompanying documentation. The copyright notices of the
unaltered, original files must be preserved in all copies of source
files.

     o Redistribution in binary form must provide a disclaimer
that states that the software is based in part of the work of the
FreeType Team, in the distribution documentation. We also encourage
you to put an URL to the FreeType web page in your documentation,
though this isn't mandatory.

These conditions apply to any software
derived from or based on the FreeType Project, not just the unmodified
files. If you use our work, you must acknowledge us. However, no fee
need be paid to us.

3. Advertising 

Neither the FreeType authors and
contributors nor you shall use the name of the other for commercial,
advertising, or promotional purposes without specific prior written
permission.

We suggest, but do not require, that you use one or more
of the following phrases to refer to this software in your
documentation or advertising materials: `FreeType Project', `FreeType
Engine', `FreeType library', or `FreeType Distribution'.

As you have
not signed this license, you are not required to accept it. However,
as the FreeType Project is copyrighted material, only this license, or
another one contracted with the authors, grants you the right to use,
distribute, and modify it. Therefore, by using, distributing, or
modifying the FreeType Project, you indicate that you understand and
accept all the terms of this license.

4. Contacts 

There are two
mailing lists related to FreeType:

     o freetype@nongnu.org

    
Discusses general use and applications of FreeType, as well as future
and wanted additions to the library and distribution. If you are
looking for support, start in this list if you haven't found anything
to help you in the documentation.

     o freetype-devel@nongnu.org

 
   Discusses bugs, as well as engine internals, design issues,
specific licenses, porting, etc.

Code Base software depend, directly or indirectly, on the License
provided in Section 2 below.

     (c) ""Source Code"" to any software

indirectly, in relation to any Downstream Distribution shall be
offered and provided on commercial terms that are reasonably

 (i) include all portions and elements of the Frameworx Code Base
required to build the Source Code of such Downstream Distribution into

4. Restrictions on Open Downstream
Distributions. Each Downstream Distribution made by You, and by any
party directly or indirectly obtaining rights to the Frameworx Code
Base through You, shall be made subject to a license grant or
agreement to the extent necessary so that each distributee under that
Downstream Distribution will be subject to the same restrictions on
re-distribution and use as are binding on You hereunder. You may
satisfy this licensing requirement either by:

     (a) requiring as a
condition to any Downstream Distribution made by you, or by any direct
or indirect distributee of Your Downstream Distribution (or any
portion or element thereof), that each distributee under the relevant
Downstream Distribution obtain a direct license (on the same terms and
conditions as those in this License Agreement) from The Frameworx
Company; or

     (b) sub-licensing all (and not less than all) of
Your rights and obligations hereunder to that distributee, including
(without limitation) Your obligation to require distributees to be
bound by license restrictions as contemplated by this Section 4
above.

The Frameworx Company hereby grants to you all rights to
sub-license your rights hereunder as necessary to fully effect the
intent and purpose of this Section 4 above, provided, however, that
your rights and obligations hereunder shall be unaffected by any such
sublicensing. In addition, The Frameworx Company expressly retains all
rights to take all appropriate action (including legal action) against
any such direct or indirect sub-licensee to ensure its full compliance
with the intent and purposes of this License Agreement.

5.
Intellectual Property. Except as expressly provided herein, this
License Agreement preserves and respects Your and The Frameworx
Companys respective intellectual property rights, including, in the
case of The Frameworx Company, its copyrights and patent rights
relating to the Frameworx Code Base.

6. Warranty Disclaimer. THE
SOFTWARE LICENSED HEREUNDER IS PROVIDED ``AS IS.'' ANY EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND
NON-INFRINGEMENT, ARE HEREBY DISCLAIMED. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE

OF USE, DATA, OR PROFITS; OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION) HOWEVER CAUSED AND
ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY OR
TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE
USE OF THIS SOFTWARE, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

7. License Violation. The License, and all of your rights
thereunder, shall be deemed automatically terminated and void as of
any Downstream Distribution directly or indirectly made or facilitated
by You that violates the provisions of this License Agreement,
provided, however, that this License Agreement shall survive any such
termination in order to remedy the effects of such violation. This
License Agreement shall be binding on the legal successors and assigns
of the parties hereto.

Your agreement to the foregoing as of the date
hereof has been evidenced by your acceptance of the relevant software
distribution hereunder.

unmodified basis, with other Modifications, as Covered Code or as part
of a Larger Work; and

          (b) under patents now or hereafter

(or portions thereof), but solely to the extent that any such patent
is reasonably necessary to enable You to Utilize the Contributor
Version (or portions thereof), and not to any greater extent that may
be necessary to Utilize further Modifications or combinations.

3.
Distribution Obligations.

     3.1. Application of License.
     The
Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are governed
by the terms of this License, including without limitation Section
2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be distributed only
under the terms of this License or a future version of this License
released under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of this
License with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not
offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or
restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients'
rights hereunder. However, You may include an additional document
offering the additional rights described in Section 3.5.

     3.2.
Availability of Source Code.
     Any Modification which You create or
to which You contribute must be made available in Source Code form
under the terms of this License either on the same media as an
Executable version or via an accepted Electronic Distribution
Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable version available;
and if made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must
remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it
initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a
subsequent version of that particular Modification has been made
available to such recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that
the Source Code version remains available even if the Electronic
Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.

     3.3.
Description of Modifications.
     You must cause all Covered Code to
which you contribute to contain a file documenting the changes You
made to create that Covered Code and the date of any change. You must
include a prominent statement that the Modification is derived,
directly or indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial
Developer and including the name of the Initial Developer in (a) the
Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version or related
documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership of the
Covered Code.

     3.4. Intellectual Property Matters

          (a)
Third Party Claims.
          If You have knowledge that a party
claims an intellectual property right in particular functionality or
code (or its utilization under this License), you must include a text
file with the source code distribution titled ""LEGAL"" which describes
the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a
recipient will know whom to contact. If you obtain such knowledge
after You make Your Modification available as described in Section
3.2, You shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies You make
available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying
appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to
inform those who received the Covered Code that new knowledge has been
obtained.

          (b) Contributor APIs.
          If Your
Modification is an application programming interface and You own or
control patents which are reasonably necessary to implement that API,
you must also include this information in the LEGAL file.

     3.5.
Required Notices.
     You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in
each file of the Source Code, and this License in any documentation
for the Source Code, where You describe recipients' rights relating to
Covered Code. If You created one or more Modification(s), You may add
your name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. If it
is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file
due to its structure, then you must include such notice in a location
(such as a relevant directory file) where a user would be likely to
look for such a notice. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee
for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or
more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your
own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any
Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty,
support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone,
and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every
Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or
such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or
liability terms You offer.

     3.6. Distribution of Executable
Versions.
     You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only
if the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered
Code, and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version
of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License,
including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the
obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included
in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or
collateral in which You descr ibe recipients' rights relating to the
Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered
Code under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different
from this License,provided that You are in compliance with the terms
of this License and that the license for the Executable version does
not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source
Code version from the rights set forth in this License. If You
distribute the Executable version under a different license You must
make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License
are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any
Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and
every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer
or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.

    
3.7. Larger Works.
     You may create a Larger Work by combining
Covered Code with other code not governed by the terms of this License
and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case,
You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for
the Covered Code.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or
Regulation.
If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the
terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code
due to statute or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms
of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the
limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be
included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must be
included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the
extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be
sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to
understand it.

5. Application of this License.
This License applies
to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the notice in
Exhibit A, and to related Covered Code.

6. Versions of the License.


    6.1. New Versions.
     Floris van den Berg may publish revised
and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version
will be given a distinguishing version number.

     6.2. Effect of
New Versions.
     Once Covered Code has been published under a
particular version of the License, You may always continue to use it
under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such
Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the License
published by Floris van den Berg
No one other than Floris van den Berg
has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created
under this License.

     6.3. Derivative Works.
     If you create or
use a modified version of this License (which you may only do in order
to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code governed by this
License), you must (a) rename Your license so that the phrases
""FreeImage"", `FreeImage Public License"", ""FIPL"", or any confusingly
similar phrase do not appear anywhere in your license and (b)
otherwise make it clear that your version of the license contains
terms which differ from the FreeImage Public License. (Filling in the
name of the Initial Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the
notice described in Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be
modifications of this License.)

7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.
COVERED
CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN ""AS IS"" BASIS, WITHOUT
WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS,
MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE
ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS
WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU
(NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST
OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF
WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY
COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

8.
TERMINATION.
This License and the rights granted hereunder will
terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and
fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the
breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted
shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by
their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this
License shall survive.

9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.
UNDER NO
CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING
NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY
OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER
OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY OTHER PERSON FOR ANY
INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY
CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL,
WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER
COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN
INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF
LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY
RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW
PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE
EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO
THAT EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

10. U.S.
GOVERNMENT END USERS.
The Covered Code is a ""commercial item,"" as that
term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of
""commercial computer software"" and ""commercial computer software
documentation,"" as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept.
1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1
through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire
Covered Code with only those rights set forth herein.

11.
MISCELLANEOUS.
This License represents the complete agreement
concerning subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is
held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the
extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be
governed by Dutch law provisions (except to the extent applicable law,
if any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions.
With respect to disputes in which at least one party is a citizen of,
or an entity chartered or registered to do business in, the The
Netherlands: (a) unless otherwise agreed in writing, all disputes
relating to this License (excepting any dispute relating to
intellectual property rights) shall be subject to final and binding
arbitration, with the losing party paying all costs of arbitration;
(b) any arbitration relating to this Agreement shall be held in
Almelo, The Netherlands; and (c) any litigation relating to this
Agreement shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the court of Almelo,
The Netherlands with the losing party responsible for costs, including
without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys fees and
expenses. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a
contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to
this License.

12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.
Except in cases where
another Contributor has failed to comply with Section 3.4, You are
responsible for damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of Your
utilization of rights under this License, based on the number of
copies of Covered Code you made available, the revenues you received
from utilizing such rights, and other relevant factors. You agree to
work with affected parties to distribute responsibility on an
equitable basis.

that decides which of the data portions to output in any given case.
We call these comments and executable code the ""non-data"" portions.
Autoconf never copies any of the non-data portions into its
output.

This special exception to the GPL applies to versions of
Autoconf released by the Free Software Foundation. When you make and
distribute a modified version of Autoconf, you may extend this special
exception to the GPL to apply to your modified version as well,
*unless* your modified version has the potential to copy into its
output some of the text that was the non-data portion of the version
that you started with. (In other words, unless your change moves or
copies text from the non-data portions to the data portions.) If your
modification has such potential, you must delete any notice of this
special exception to the GPL from your modified version.

GCC RUNTIME LIBRARY EXCEPTION
Version 3.1,
31 March 2009

General
information:
http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gcc-exception.html
Copyright
(C) 2009 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>

Everyone is
permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license
document, but changing it is not allowed.
This GCC Runtime Library
Exception (""Exception"") is an additional permission under section 7 of
the GNU General Public License, version 3 (""GPLv3""). It applies to a
given file (the ""Runtime Library"") that bears a notice placed by the
copyright holder of the file stating that the file is governed by
GPLv3 along with this Exception.

When you use GCC to compile a
program, GCC may combine portions of certain GCC header files and
runtime libraries with the compiled program. The purpose of this
Exception is to allow compilation of non-GPL (including proprietary)
programs to use, in this way, the header files and runtime libraries
covered by this Exception.

0. Definitions.
A file is an ""Independent
Module"" if it either requires the Runtime Library for execution after
a Compilation Process, or makes use of an interface provided by the
Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based on the Runtime
Library.
""GCC"" means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or
without modifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later
version) of the GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of
using any subsequent versions published by the FSF.
""GPL-compatible
Software"" is software whose conditions of propagation, modification
and use would permit combination with GCC in accord with the license
of GCC.

""Target Code"" refers to output from any compiler for a real
or virtual target processor architecture, in executable form or
suitable for input to an assembler, loader, linker and/or execution
phase. Notwithstanding that, Target Code does not include data in any
format that is used as a compiler intermediate representation, or used
for producing a compiler intermediate representation.
The ""Compilation
Process"" transforms code entirely represented in non-intermediate
languages designed for human-written code, and/or in Java Virtual
Machine byte code, into Target Code. Thus, for example, use of source
code generators and preprocessors need not be considered part of the
Compilation Process, since the Compilation Process can be understood
as starting with the output of the generators or preprocessors.

A
Compilation Process is ""Eligible"" if it is done using GCC, alone or
with other GPL-compatible software, or if it is done without using any
work based on GCC. For example, using non-GPL-compatible Software to
optimize any GCC intermediate representations would not qualify as an
Eligible Compilation Process.

1. Grant of Additional Permission.
You
have permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by combining
the Runtime Library with Independent Modules, even if such propagation
would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3, provided that all Target
Code was generated by Eligible Compilation Processes. You may then
convey such a combination under terms of your choice, consistent with
the licensing of the Independent Modules.

2. No Weakening of GCC
Copyleft.
The availability of this Exception does not imply any
general presumption that third-party software is unaffected by the
copyleft requirements of the license of GCC.

AUTOCONF CONFIGURE SCRIPT EXCEPTION

Version
3.0, 18 August 2009

Copyright © 2009 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
<http://fsf.org/>

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute
verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not
allowed.

This Exception is an additional permission under section 7
of the GNU General Public License, version 3 (""GPLv3""). It applies to
a given file that bears a notice placed by the copyright holder of the
file stating that the file is governed by GPLv3 along with this
Exception.

The purpose of this Exception is to allow distribution of
Autoconf's typical output under terms of the recipient's choice
(including proprietary).

0. Definitions.
""Covered Code"" is the source
or object code of a version of Autoconf that is a covered work under
this License.

""Normally Copied Code"" for a version of Autoconf means
all parts of its Covered Code which that version can copy from its
code (i.e., not from its input file) into its minimally verbose,
non-debugging and non-tracing output.

""Ineligible Code"" is Covered
Code that is not Normally Copied Code.

1. Grant of Additional
Permission.
You have permission to propagate output of Autoconf, even
if such propagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3.
However, if by modifying Autoconf you cause any Ineligible Code of the
version you received to become Normally Copied Code of your modified
version, then you void this Exception for the resulting covered work.
If you convey that resulting covered work, you must remove this
Exception in accordance with the second paragraph of Section 7 of
GPLv3.

2. No Weakening of Autoconf Copyleft.
The availability of this
Exception does not imply any general presumption that third-party
software is unaffected by the copyleft requirements of the license of
Autoconf.

Allegro is gift-ware. It was created
by a number of people working in cooperation, and is given to you
freely as a gift. You may use, modify, redistribute, and generally
hack it about in any way you like, and you do not have to give us
anything in return.

However, if you like this product you are
encouraged to thank us by making a return gift to the Allegro
community. This could be by writing an add-on package, providing a
useful bug report, making an improvement to the library, or perhaps
just releasing the sources of your program so that other people can
learn from them. If you redistribute parts of this code or make a game
using it, it would be nice if you mentioned Allegro somewhere in the
credits, but you are not required to do this. We trust you not to
abuse our generosity.

1. PREAMBLE

This
license is for software that provides a 3D graphics application
program interface (API).The license is intended to offer terms similar
to some standard General Public Licenses designed to foster open
standards and unrestricted accessibility to source code. Some of these
licenses require that, as a condition of the license of the software,
any derivative works (that is, new software which is a work containing
the original program or a portion of it) must be available for general
use, without restriction other than for a minor transfer fee, and that
the source code for such derivative works must likewise be made
available. The only restriction is that such derivative works must be
subject to the same General Public License terms as the original work.


This 3dfx GLIDE Source Code General Public License differs from the
standard licenses of this type in that it does not require the entire
derivative work to be made available under the terms of this license
nor is the recipient required to make available the source code for
the entire derivative work. Rather, the license is limited to only the
identifiable portion of the derivative work that is derived from the
licensed software. The precise terms and conditions for copying,
distribution and modification follow. 

2. DEFINITIONS

     2.1 This
License applies to any program (or other ""work"") which contains a
notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this 3dfx GLIDE Source Code General Public License.


     2.2 The term ""Program"" as used in this Agreement refers to
3DFX's GLIDE source code and object code and any Derivative Work.

   
 2.3 ""Derivative Work"" means, for the purpose of the License, that
portion of any work that contains the Program or the identifiable
portion of a work that is derived from the Program, either verbatim or
with modifications and/or translated into another language, and that
performs 3D graphics API operations. It does not include any other
portions of a work.

     2.4 ""Modifications of the Program"" means any
work, which includes a Derivative Work, and includes the whole of such
work.

     2.5 ""License"" means this 3dfx GLIDE Source Code General
Public License.

     2.6 The ""Source Code"" for a work means the
preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For an
executable work, complete source code means all the source code for
all modules it contains, any associated interface definition files,
and the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the
executable work.

     2.7 ""3dfx"" means 3dfx Interactive, Inc. 

3.
LICENSED ACTIVITIES

     3.1 COPYING - You may copy and distribute
verbatim copies of the Program's Source Code as you receive it, in any
medium, subject to the provision of section 3.3 and provided also
that:

          (a) you conspicuously and appropriately publish on
each copy an appropriate copyright notice (3dfx Interactive, Inc.
1999), a notice that recipients who wish to copy, distribute or modify
the Program can only do so subject to this License, and a disclaimer
of warranty as set forth in section 5;

          (b) keep intact all
the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
warranty; and 

          (c) do not make any use of the GLIDE
trademark without the prior written permission of 3dfx, and 

        
 (d) give all recipients of the Program a copy of this License along
with the Program or instructions on how to easily receive a copy of
this License. 

     3.2 MODIFICATION OF THE PROGRAM/DERIVATIVE WORKS
- You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of
it, and copy and distribute such modifications subject to the
provisions of section 3.3 and provided that you also meet all of the
following conditions: 

          (a) you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy of a Derivative Work an appropriate
copyright notice, a notice that recipients who wish to copy,
distribute or modify the Derivative Work can only do so subject to
this License, and a disclaimer of warranty as set forth in section
5;

          (b) keep intact all the notices that refer to this
License and to the absence of any warranty; and (c) give all
recipients of the Derivative Work a copy of this License along with
the Derivative Work or instructions on how to easily receive a copy of
this License.

          (d) You must cause the modified files of the
Derivative Work to carry prominent notices stating that you changed
the files and the date of any change. 

          (e) You must cause
any Derivative Work that you distribute or publish to be licensed at
no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License. 

    
     (f) You do not make any use of the GLIDE trademark without the
prior written permission of 3dfx. 

          (g) If the Derivative
Work normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause
it, when started running for such interactive use, to print or display
an announcement as follows:

          ""COPYRIGHT 3DFX INTERACTIVE,
INC. 1999, ALL RIGHTS RESERVED THIS SOFTWARE IS FREE AND PROVIDED ""AS

IS NO RIGHT TO USE THE GLIDE TRADEMARK WITHOUT PRIOR WRITTEN
PERMISSION OF 3DFX INTERACTIVE, INC. SEE THE 3DFX GLIDE GENERAL PUBLIC
LICENSE FOR A FULL TEXT OF THE DISTRIBUTION AND NON-WARRANTY
PROVISIONS (REQUEST COPY FROM INFO@3DFX.COM).""

          (h) The
requirements of this section 3.2 do not apply to the modified work as
a whole but only to the Derivative Work. It is not the intent of this
License to claim rights or contest your rights to work written
entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to
control the distribution of Derivative Works. 

     3.3 DISTRIBUTION


          (a) All copies of the Program or Derivative Works which
are distributed must include in the file headers the following
language verbatim:

          ""THIS SOFTWARE IS SUBJECT TO COPYRIGHT
PROTECTION AND IS OFFERED ONLY PURSUANT TO THE 3DFX GLIDE GENERAL

UNDER THE COPYRIGHT LAWS OF THE UNITED STATES.

          COPYRIGHT
3DFX INTERACTIVE, INC. 1999, ALL RIGHTS RESERVED""

          (b) You
may distribute the Program or a Derivative Work in object code or
executable form under the terms of Sections 3.1 and 3.2 provided that
you also do one of the following: 

               (1) Accompany it
with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 3.1 and 3.2; or, 
    
          
               (2) Accompany it with a written offer, valid
for at least three years, to give any third party, for a charge no
more than your cost of physically performing source distribution, a
complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
distributed under the terms of Sections 3.1 and 3.2 on a medium
customarily used for software interchange; or, 

               (3)
Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to
distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed
only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the
program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in
accord with Subsection 3.3(b)(2) above.) 

          (c) The source
code distributed need not include anything that is normally
distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
the executable code. 

          (d) If distribution of executable
code or object code is made by offering access to copy from a
designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source
code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code,
even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along
with the object code. 

          (e) Each time you redistribute the
Program or any Derivative Work, the recipient automatically receives a
license from 3dfx and successor licensors to copy, distribute or
modify the Program and Derivative Works subject to the terms and
conditions of the License. You may not impose any further restrictions
on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not
responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.


          (f) You may not make any use of the GLIDE trademark
without the prior written permission of 3dfx.

          (g) You may
not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program or any
Derivative Works except as expressly provided under this License. Any
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the
Program or any Derivative Works is void, and will automatically
terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have
received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have
their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full
compliance.

4. MISCELLANEOUS

     4.1 Acceptance of this License is
voluntary. By using, modifying or distributing the Program or any
Derivative Work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do
so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or
modifying the Program or works based on it. Nothing else grants you
permission to modify or distribute the Program or Derivative Works and
doing so without acceptance of this License is in violation of the
U.S. and international copyright laws.

     4.2 If the distribution
and/or use of the Program or Derivative Works is restricted in certain
countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original
copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an
explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those
countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

     4.3
This License is to be construed according to the laws of the State of
California and you consent to personal jurisdiction in the State of
California in the event it is necessary to enforce the provisions of
this License. 

5. NO WARRANTIES

     5.1 TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM. OR DERIVATIVE
WORKS THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM
AND ANY DERIVATIVE WORKS""AS IS"" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER

In plain English:

1.
We don't promise that this software works. (But if you find any bugs,
please let us know!) 
2. You can use this software for whatever you
want. You don't have to pay us. 
3. You may not pretend that you wrote
this software. If you use it in a program, you must acknowledge
somewhere in your documentation that you've used the IJG code.

In
legalese:

The authors make NO WARRANTY or representation, either
express or implied, with respect to this software, its quality,
accuracy, merchantability, or fitness for a particular purpose. This
software is provided ""AS IS"", and you, its user, assume the entire
risk as to its quality and accuracy.

This software is copyright (C)

below.

Permission is hereby granted to use, copy, modify, and
distribute this software (or portions thereof) for any purpose,
without fee, subject to these conditions:    

     (1) If any part of
the source code for this software is distributed, then this README
file must be included, with this copyright and no-warranty notice
unaltered; and any additions, deletions, or changes to the original
files must be clearly indicated in accompanying documentation. 
    
(2) If only executable code is distributed, then the accompanying
documentation must state that ""this software is based in part on the
work of the Independent JPEG Group"". 
     (3) Permission for use of
this software is granted only if the user accepts full responsibility
for any undesirable consequences; the authors accept NO LIABILITY for
damages of any kind.

These conditions apply to any software derived
from or based on the IJG code, not just to the unmodified library. If
you use our work, you ought to acknowledge us.

Permission is NOT
granted for the use of any IJG author's name or company name in
advertising or publicity relating to this software or products derived

ansi2knr.c is included in this distribution by permission of L.
Peter Deutsch, sole proprietor of its copyright holder, Aladdin
Enterprises of Menlo Park, CA. ansi2knr.c is NOT covered by the above
copyright and conditions, but instead by the usual distribution terms
of the Free Software Foundation; principally, that you must include
source code if you redistribute it. (See the file ansi2knr.c for full
details.) However, since ansi2knr.c is not needed as part of any
program generated from the IJG code, this does not limit you more than
the foregoing paragraphs do.

The Unix configuration script
""configure"" was produced with GNU Autoconf. It is copyright by the
Free Software Foundation but is freely distributable. The same holds
for its supporting scripts (config.guess, config.sub, ltconfig,
ltmain.sh). Another support script, install-sh, is copyright by M.I.T.
but is also freely distributable.

It appears that the arithmetic
coding option of the JPEG spec is covered by patents owned by IBM,
AT&T, and Mitsubishi. Hence arithmetic coding cannot legally be used
without obtaining one or more licenses. For this reason, support for
arithmetic coding has been removed from the free JPEG software. (Since
arithmetic coding provides only a marginal gain over the unpatented
Huffman mode, it is unlikely that very many implementations will
support it.) So far as we are aware, there are no patent restrictions
on the remaining code.

The IJG distribution formerly included code to
read and write GIF files. To avoid entanglement with the Unisys LZW
patent, GIF reading support has been removed altogether, and the GIF
writer has been simplified to produce ""uncompressed GIFs"". This
technique does not use the LZW algorithm; the resulting GIF files are
larger than usual, but are readable by all standard GIF decoders.

We
are required to state that 
     ""The Graphics Interchange Format(c)
is the Copyright property of CompuServe Incorporated. GIF(sm) is a
Service Mark property of CompuServe Incorporated.""

THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED
UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS IBM
PUBLIC LICENSE (""AGREEMENT""). ANY USE,
REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION
OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S
ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.

1. DEFINITIONS
""Contribution""
means:

a.  in the case of International Business Machines Corporation
(""IBM""), the Original Program, and

b.  in the case of each
Contributor,
	i.  changes to the Program, and
	ii.  additions to the
Program;
where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate
from and
are distributed by that particular Contributor. A
Contribution
'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to the
Program by
such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such
Contributor's
behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the
Program which:
(i) are separate modules of software distributed in
conjunction with
the Program under their own license agreement, and
(ii) are not
derivative works of the Program.

""Contributor"" means IBM
and any other entity that distributes the Program.

""Licensed Patents
"" mean patent claims licensable by a
Contributor which are necessarily
infringed by the use or sale of its
Contribution alone or when
combined with the Program.

""Original Program"" means the original
version of the software
accompanying this Agreement as released by
IBM, including source
code, object code and documentation, if
any.

""Program"" means the Original Program and
Contributions.

""Recipient"" means anyone who receives the Program
under this
Agreement, including all Contributors.

2. GRANT OF
RIGHTS
a.  Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor
hereby
grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
copyright
license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly
display,
publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution
of such
Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code
and
object code form.

b.  Subject to the terms of this Agreement,
each Contributor hereby
grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide,
royalty-free patent
license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell,
offer to sell,
import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such
Contributor,
if any, in source code and object code form. This patent
license
shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the
Program
if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor,
such
addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be
covered by
the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to
any
other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware
per
se is licensed hereunder.

c.  Recipient understands that although
each Contributor grants the
licenses to its Contributions set forth
herein, no assurances are
provided by any Contributor that the Program
does not infringe the
patent or other intellectual property rights of
any other entity.
Each Contributor disclaims any liability to
Recipient for claims
brought by any other entity based on infringement
of intellectual
property rights or otherwise. As a condition to
exercising the
rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient
hereby assumes
sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual
property rights
needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent
license is
required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it
is
Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license
before
distributing the Program.

d.  Each Contributor represents that
to its knowledge it has
sufficient copyright rights in its
Contribution, if any, to grant the
copyright license set forth in this
Agreement.

3. REQUIREMENTS
A Contributor may choose to distribute
the
Program in object code form under its own license agreement,
provided
that:

a.  it complies with the terms and conditions of this
Agreement; and
b.  its license agreement:
	i.  effectively disclaims
on behalf of all Contributors all warranties
	and conditions, express
and implied, including warranties or
	conditions of title and
non-infringement, and implied warranties or
	conditions of
merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;
	ii. 
effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability
	for
damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental
and
	consequential damages, such as lost profits;
	iii.  states that
any provisions which differ from this Agreement are
	offered by that
Contributor alone and not by any other party; and
	iv.  states that
source code for the Program is available from such
	Contributor, and
informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable
	manner on or
through a medium customarily used for software exchange.

When the
Program is made available in source code form:
a.  it must be made
available under this Agreement; and
b.  a copy of this Agreement must
be included with each copy of the
Program.

Each Contributor must
include the following in a conspicuous location in the
Program:

	Copyright (C) 1996, 1999 International Business Machines
Corporation and others. All Rights Reserved.

In addition, each
Contributor must identify itself as the originator
of its
Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows
subsequent
Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.

4.
COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
Commercial distributors of software may accept
certain
responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners
and the
like. While this license is intended to facilitate the
commercial
use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the
Program in a
commercial product offering should do so in a manner
which does not
create potential liability for other Contributors.
Therefore, if a
Contributor includes the Program in a commercial
product offering,
such Contributor (""Commercial Contributor"") hereby
agrees to defend
and indemnify every other Contributor (""Indemnified
Contributor"")
against any losses, damages and costs (collectively
""Losses"") arising
from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions
brought by a third
party against the Indemnified Contributor to the
extent caused by the
acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor
in connection with
its distribution of the Program in a commercial
product offering.
The obligations in this section do not apply to any
claims or Losses
relating to any actual or alleged intellectual
property infringement.
In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor
must: a) promptly
notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such
claim, and b)
allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and
cooperate with the
Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any
related settlement
negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may
participate in any
such claim at its own expense.

For example, a
Contributor might include the Program in a commercial
product
offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a
Commercial
Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes
performance
claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those
performance
claims and warranties are such Commercial
Contributor's
responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial
Contributor
would have to defend claims against the other Contributors
related to
those performance claims and warranties, and if a court
requires any
other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the
Commercial
Contributor must pay those damages.

5. NO WARRANTY
EXCEPT
AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS
PROVIDED ON
AN ""AS IS"" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY
KIND, EITHER
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY
WARRANTIES OR
CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY
OR FITNESS FOR
A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely
responsible for
determining the appropriateness of using and
distributing the Program
and assumes all risks associated with its
exercise of rights under
this Agreement, including but not limited to
the risks and costs of
program errors, compliance with applicable
laws, damage to or loss of
data, programs or equipment, and
unavailability or interruption of
operations.

6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH
IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT
NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE
ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT,
INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,
EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES
(INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST
PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON
ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN
CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR
TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR
OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF
THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE
PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS
GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF
ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. GENERAL
If any
provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable
under
applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or
enforceability of
the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and
without further
action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be
reformed to the
minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid
and enforceable.

If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a
Contributor with
respect to a patent applicable to software (including
a cross-claim
or counterclaim in a lawsuit), then any patent licenses
granted by
that Contributor to such Recipient under this Agreement
shall
terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. In addition,
if
Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity
(including
a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
the Program
itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other
software or
hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such
Recipient's
rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of
the date such
litigation is filed.

All Recipient's rights under this
Agreement shall terminate if it
fails to comply with any of the
material terms or conditions of this
Agreement and does not cure such
failure in a reasonable period of
time after becoming aware of such
noncompliance. If all Recipient's
rights under this Agreement
terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use
and distribution of the
Program as soon as reasonably practicable.
However, Recipient's
obligations under this Agreement and any
licenses granted by Recipient
relating to the Program shall continue
and survive.

IBM may publish
new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement
from time to
time. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a
distinguishing
version number. The Program (including Contributions)
may always be
distributed subject to the version of the Agreement
under which it was
received. In addition, after a new version of the
Agreement is
published, Contributor may elect to distribute the
Program (including
its Contributions) under the new version. No one
other than IBM has
the right to modify this Agreement. Except as
expressly stated in
Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives
no rights or licenses
to the intellectual property of any Contributor
under this Agreement,
whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or
otherwise. All rights
in the Program not expressly granted under
this Agreement are
reserved.

This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New
York and
the intellectual property laws of the United States of
America. No
party to this Agreement will bring a legal action under
this
Agreement more than one year after the cause of action arose.
Each
party waives its rights to a jury trial in any resulting
litigation.

thereof.

the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions to
that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally submitted

applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor
that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by
combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such
Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation
against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a
lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within
the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then
any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work
shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

4.
Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or
Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications,
and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following
conditions:

     a. You must give any other recipients of the Work or

following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the
Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided
along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the
Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally
appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes
only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as
an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such
additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the
License. 

You may add Your own copyright statement to Your
modifications and may provide additional or different license terms
and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your
modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided
Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise
complies with the conditions stated in this License.

5. Submission of
Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution
intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the
Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License,

grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor
be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work
(including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work
stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other
commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been
advised of the possibility of such damages.

9. Accepting Warranty or
Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative
Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for,
acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability
obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in
accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on
Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and
only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor
harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against,
such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or
additional liability.

[ Copyleft Attitude ]

Version 1.2

Préambule
:

Avec cette Licence Art Libre, l’autorisation est donnée de
copier, de diffuser et de transformer librement les oeuvres dans le
respect des droits de l’auteur.

Loin d’ignorer les droits de
l’auteur, cette licence les reconnaît et les protège. Elle en
reformule le principe en permettant au public de faire un usage
créatif des oeuvres d’art. 

Alors que l’usage fait du droit de
la propriété littéraire et artistique conduit à restreindre
l’accès du public à l’oeuvre, la Licence Art Libre a pour but de
le favoriser. 

L’intention est d’ouvrir l’accès et
d’autoriser l’utilisation des ressources d’une oeuvre par le
plus grand nombre. En avoir jouissance pour en multiplier les
réjouissances, créer de nouvelles conditions de création pour
amplifier les possibilités de création. Dans le respect des auteurs
avec la reconnaissance et la défense de leur droit moral.

En effet,
avec la venue du numérique, l’invention de l’internet et des
logiciels libres, un nouveau mode de création et de production est
apparu. Il est aussi l’amplification de ce qui a été expérimenté
par nombre d’artistes contemporains.
Le savoir et la création sont
des ressources qui doivent demeurer libres pour être encore
véritablement du savoir et de la création. C’est à dire rester
une recherche fondamentale qui ne soit pas directement liée à une
application concrète. Créer c’est découvrir l’inconnu, c’est
inventer le réel avant tout souci de réalisme. 

Ainsi, l’objet
de l’art n’est pas confondu avec l’objet d’art fini et défini
comme tel. 
C’est la raison essentielle de cette Licence Art Libre
: promouvoir et protéger des pratiques artistiques libérées des
seules règles de l’économie de marché.

DÉFINITIONS

Préambule :

Avec la Licence Art
Libre, l’autorisation est donnée de copier, de diffuser et de
transformer librement les œuvres dans le respect des droits de
l’auteur.

Loin d’ignorer ces droits, la Licence Art Libre les
reconnaît et les protège. Elle en reformule l’exercice en
permettant à tout un chacun de faire un usage créatif des
productions de l’esprit quels que soient leur genre et leur forme
d’expression.

Si, en règle générale, l’application du droit
d’auteur conduit à restreindre l’accès aux œuvres de
l’esprit, la Licence Art Libre, au contraire, le favorise.
L’intention est d’autoriser l’utilisation des ressources d’une
œuvre ; créer de nouvelles conditions de création pour amplifier
les possibilités de création. La Licence Art Libre permet d’avoir
jouissance des œuvres tout en reconnaissant les droits et les
responsabilités de chacun.

Avec le développement du numérique,
l’invention d’internet et des logiciels libres, les modalités de
création ont évolué : les productions de l’esprit s’offrent
naturellement à la circulation, à l’échange et aux
transformations. Elles se prêtent favorablement à la réalisation
d’œuvres communes que chacun peut augmenter pour l’avantage de
tous.

C’est la raison essentielle de la Licence Art Libre :
promouvoir et protéger ces productions de l’esprit selon les
principes du copyleft : liberté d’usage, de copie, de diffusion, de
transformation et interdiction d’appropriation
exclusive.

Définitions :

Nous désignons par « œuvre », autant
l’œuvre initiale, les œuvres conséquentes, que l’œuvre commune
telles que définies ci-après :

L’œuvre commune : 
Il s’agit
d’une œuvre qui comprend l’œuvre initiale ainsi que toutes les
contributions postérieures (les originaux conséquents et les
copies). Elle est créée à l’initiative de l’auteur initial qui
par cette licence définit les conditions selon lesquelles les
contributions sont faites.

L’œuvre initiale : 
C’est-à-dire
l’œuvre créée par l’initiateur de l’œuvre commune dont les
copies vont être modifiées par qui le souhaite.

Les œuvres
conséquentes : 
C’est-à-dire les contributions des auteurs qui
participent à la formation de l’œuvre commune en faisant usage des
droits de reproduction, de diffusion et de modification que leur
confère la licence.

Originaux (sources ou ressources de l’œuvre)
: 
Chaque exemplaire daté de l’œuvre initiale ou conséquente que
leurs auteurs présentent comme référence pour toutes
actualisations, interprétations, copies ou reproductions
ultérieures.

Copie : 
Toute reproduction d’un original au sens de
cette licence.

1- OBJET.
Cette licence a pour objet de définir les
conditions selon lesquelles vous pouvez jouir librement de
l’œuvre.

2. L’ÉTENDUE DE LA JOUISSANCE.

soumise au droit d’auteur, et l’auteur par cette licence vous
indique quelles sont vos libertés pour la copier, la diffuser et la
modifier.

2.1 LA LIBERTÉ DE COPIER (OU DE REPRODUCTION).
Vous avez
la liberté de copier cette œuvre pour vous, vos amis ou toute autre
personne, quelle que soit la technique employée.

3. DROITS CONNEXES.
Les actes donnant lieu
à des droits d’auteur ou des droits voisins ne doivent pas
constituer un obstacle aux libertés conférées par cette
licence. 
C’est pourquoi, par exemple, les interprétations doivent
être soumises à la même licence ou une licence compatible. De
même, l’intégration de l’œuvre à une base de données, une
compilation ou une anthologie ne doit pas faire obstacle à la
jouissance de l’œuvre telle que définie par cette licence.

4.
L’ INTÉGRATION DE L’ŒUVRE.
Toute intégration de cette œuvre à
un ensemble non soumis à la LAL doit assurer l’exercice des

l’œuvre, y compris à des fins lucratives, et sans autres
restrictions que celles qu’impose le respect des autres critères de
compatibilité ;
     2.	elle garantit la paternité de l’œuvre et
l’accès aux versions antérieures de l’œuvre quand cet accès
est possible ;
     3.	elle reconnaît la LAL également compatible
(réciprocité) ;
     4.	elle impose que les modifications faites sur
l’œuvre soient soumises à la même licence ou encore à une
licence répondant aux critères de compatibilité posés par la
LAL.

vos droits d’auteur sur votre contribution ni vos droits connexes.
En choisissant de contribuer à l’évolution de cette œuvre
commune, vous acceptez seulement d’offrir aux autres les mêmes
autorisations sur votre contribution que celles qui vous ont été
accordées par cette licence. Ces autorisations n’entraînent pas un
dessaisissement de vos droits intellectuels.

7. VOS
RESPONSABILITÉS.
La liberté de jouir de l’œuvre tel que permis
par la LAL (liberté de copier, diffuser, modifier) implique pour
chacun la responsabilité de ses propres faits.

Cette licence prend effet dès votre acceptation de ses
dispositions. Le fait de copier, de diffuser, ou de modifier
l’œuvre constitue une acceptation tacite. 

Cette licence a pour
durée la durée des droits d’auteur attachés à l’œuvre. Si

     Version 3, 29 June 2007

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software
Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
 
Everyone is permitted to copy and
distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it
is not allowed.

This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License
incorporates the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General
Public License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed
below.

0. Additional Definitions.

As used herein, ""this License""
refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser General Public License, and the
""GNU GPL"" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

""The
Library"" refers to a covered work governed by this License, other than
an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.

An ""Application""
is any work that makes use of an interface provided by the Library,
but which is not otherwise based on the Library. Defining a subclass
of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode of using an
interface provided by the Library.

A ""Combined Work"" is a work
produced by combining or linking an Application with the Library.  The
particular version of the Library with which the Combined Work was
made is also called the ""Linked Version"".

The ""Minimal Corresponding
Source"" for a Combined Work means the Corresponding Source for the
Combined Work, excluding any source code for portions of the Combined
Work that, considered in isolation, are based on the Application, and
not on the Linked Version.

The ""Corresponding Application Code"" for a
Combined Work means the object code and/or source code for the
Application, including any data and utility programs needed for
reproducing the Combined Work from the Application, but excluding the
System Libraries of the Combined Work.

1. Exception to Section 3 of
the GNU GPL.
You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of
this License without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.

2.
Conveying Modified Versions.
If you modify a copy of the Library, and,
in your modifications, a facility refers to a function or data to be
supplied by an Application that uses the facility (other than as an
argument passed when the facility is invoked), then you may convey a
copy of the modified version:

   a) under this License, provided that
you make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an
Application does not supply the function or data, the facility still
operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains
meaningful, or

   b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional
permissions of this License applicable to that copy.

3. Object Code
Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.
The object code form
of an Application may incorporate material from a header file that is
part of the Library.  You may convey such object code under terms of
your choice, provided that, if the incorporated material is not
limited to numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors,
or small macros, inline functions and templates (ten or fewer lines in
length), you do both of the following:

   a) Give prominent notice
with each copy of the object code that the Library is used in it and
that the Library and its use are covered by this License.

   b)
Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
document.

4. Combined Works.
You may convey a Combined Work under
terms of your choice that, taken together, effectively do not restrict
modification of the portions of the Library contained in the Combined
Work and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications, if you
also do each of the following:

   a) Give prominent notice with each
copy of the Combined Work that the Library is used in it and that the
Library and its use are covered by this License.

   b) Accompany the
Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document.

 
 c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during
execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among these
notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the copies of
the GNU GPL and this license document.

   d) Do one of the
following:

       0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under
the terms of this License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a
form suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to recombine
or relink the Application with a modified version of the Linked
Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the manner specified
by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.

     
 1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time a copy
of the Library already present on the user's computer system, and (b)
will operate properly with a modified version of the Library that is
interface-compatible with the Linked Version.

   e) Provide
Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise be required
to provide such information under section 6 of the GNU GPL, and only
to the extent that such information is necessary to install and
execute a modified version of the Combined Work produced by
recombining or relinking the Application with a modified version of
the Linked Version. (If you use option 4d0, the Installation
Information must accompany the Minimal Corresponding Source and
Corresponding Application Code. If you use option 4d1, you must
provide the Installation Information in the manner specified by
section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.)

5.
Combined Libraries.
You may place library facilities that are a work
based on the Library side by side in a single library together with
other library facilities that are not Applications and are not covered
by this License, and convey such a combined library under terms of
your choice, if you do both of the following:

   a) Accompany the
combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library,
uncombined with any other library facilities, conveyed under the terms
of this License.

   b) Give prominent notice with the combined
library that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

6.
Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.
The Free
Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU
Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions
will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in
detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a
distinguishing version number. If the Library as you received it
specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Lesser General
Public License ""or any later version"" applies to it, you have the
option of following the terms and conditions either of that published
version or of any later version published by the Free Software
Foundation. If the Library as you received it does not specify a
version number of the GNU Lesser General Public License, you may
choose any version of the GNU Lesser General Public License ever
published by the Free Software Foundation.

If the Library as you
received it specifies that a proxy can decide whether future versions
of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall
apply, that proxy's
public statement of acceptance of any version is permanent
authorization for you to choose that version for the Library.

without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.

2. Conveying
Modified Versions.
If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your

choice, provided that, if the incorporated material is not limited to
numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, or small
macros, inline functions and templates (ten or fewer lines in length),
you do both of the following:

     a) Give prominent notice with each

Preamble

The
licenses for most data are designed to take away your freedom to share
and change it. By contrast, this License is intended to guarantee your
freedom to share and change free data--to make sure the data are free
for all their users.

This License, the Lesser General Public License
for Linguistic Resources, applies to some specially designated
linguistic resources -- typically lexicons and grammars. 

TERMS AND
CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

0. This License
Agreement applies to any Linguistic Resource which contains a notice
placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may
be distributed under the terms of this Lesser General Public License
for Linguistic Resources (also called ""this License""). Each licensee
is addressed as ""you"".

A ""linguistic resource"" means a collection of
data about language prepared so as to be used with application
programs.

The ""Linguistic Resource"", below, refers to any such work
which has been distributed under these terms. A ""work based on the
Linguistic Resource"" means either the Linguistic Resource or any
derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing
the Linguistic Resource or a portion of it, either verbatim or with
modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into another
language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term ""modification"".)

""Legible form"" for a linguistic resource
means the preferred form of the resource for making modifications to
it.

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are
not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of
running a program using the Linguistic Resource is not restricted, and
output from such a program is covered only if its contents constitute
a work based on the Linguistic Resource (independent of the use of the
Linguistic Resource in a tool for writing it). Whether that is true
depends on what the program that uses the Linguistic Resource
does.

1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the
Linguistic Resource as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
Linguistic Resource.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of
transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty
protection in exchange for a fee.

2. You may modify your copy or
copies of the Linguistic Resource or any portion of it, thus forming a
work based on the Linguistic Resource, and copy and distribute such
modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided
that you also meet all of these conditions:

     a) The modified work
must itself be a linguistic resource. 

     b) You must cause the
files modified to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the
files and the date of any change. 

     c) You must cause the whole
of the work to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under the
terms of this License.

These requirements apply to the modified work
as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from
the Linguistic Resource, and can be reasonably considered independent
and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do
not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate
works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole
which is a work based on the Linguistic Resource, the distribution of
the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for
other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every
part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this
section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written
entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to
control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on
the Linguistic Resource.

In addition, mere aggregation of another
work not based on the Linguistic Resource with the Linguistic Resource
(or with a work based on the Linguistic Resource) on a volume of a
storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the
scope of this License.

3. A program that contains no derivative of
any portion of the Linguistic Resource, but is designed to work with
the Linguistic Resource (or an encrypted form of the Linguistic
Resource) by reading it or being compiled or linked with it, is called
a ""work that uses the Linguistic Resource"". Such a work, in isolation,
is not a derivative work of the Linguistic Resource, and therefore
falls outside the scope of this License.

However, combining a ""work
that uses the Linguistic Resource"" with the Linguistic Resource (or an
encrypted form of the Linguistic Resource) creates a package that is a
derivative of the Linguistic Resource (because it contains portions of
the Linguistic Resource), rather than a ""work that uses the Linguistic
Resource"". If the package is a derivative of the Linguistic Resource,
you may distribute the package under the terms of Section 4. Any works
containing that package also fall under Section 4.

4. As an exception
to the Sections above, you may also combine a ""work that uses the
Linguistic Resource"" with the Linguistic Resource (or an encrypted
form of the Linguistic Resource) to produce a package containing
portions of the Linguistic Resource, and distribute that package under
terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit modification of
the package for the customer's own use and reverse engineering for
debugging such modifications.

You must give prominent notice with
each copy of the package that the Linguistic Resource is used in it
and that the Linguistic Resource and its use are covered by this
License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the package during
execution displays copyright notices, you must include the copyright
notice for the Linguistic Resource among them, as well as a reference
directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one
of these things:

     a) Accompany the package with the complete
corresponding machine-readable legible form of the Linguistic Resource
including whatever changes were used in the package (which must be
distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the package
contains an encrypted form of the Linguistic Resource, with the
complete machine-readable ""work that uses the Linguistic Resource"", as
object code and/or source code, so that the user can modify the
Linguistic Resource and then encrypt it to produce a modified package
containing the modified Linguistic Resource. 

     b) Use a suitable
mechanism for combining with the Linguistic Resource. A suitable
mechanism is one that will operate properly with a modified version of
the Linguistic Resource, if the user installs one, as long as the
modified version is interface-compatible with the version that the
package was made with. 

     c) Accompany the package with a written
offer, valid for at least three years, to give the same user the
materials specified in Subsection 4a, above, for a charge no more than
the cost of performing this distribution. 

     d) If distribution of
the package is made by offering access to copy from a designated
place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified materials
from the same place. 

     e) Verify that the user has already
received a copy of these materials or that you have already sent this
user a copy.

If the package includes an encrypted form of the
Linguistic Resource, the required form of the ""work that uses the
Linguistic Resource"" must include any data and utility programs needed
for reproducing the package from it. However, as a special exception,
the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
the executable.

It may happen that this requirement contradicts the
license restrictions of proprietary libraries that do not normally
accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot
use both them and the Linguistic Resource together in a package that
you distribute.

5. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with,
or distribute the Linguistic Resource except as expressly provided
under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense,
link with, or distribute the Linguistic Resource is void, and will
automatically terminate your rights under this License. However,
parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this
License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

6. You are not required to accept
this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else
grants you permission to modify or distribute the Linguistic Resource
or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do
not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the
Linguistic Resource (or any work based on the Linguistic Resource),
you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its
terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the
Linguistic Resource or works based on it.

7. Each time you
redistribute the Linguistic Resource (or any work based on the
Linguistic Resource), the recipient automatically receives a license
from the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify
the Linguistic Resource subject to these terms and conditions. You may
not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the
rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing
compliance by third parties with this License.

8. If, as a
consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement
or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are
imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that
contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from
the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to
satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any
other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not
distribute the Linguistic Resource at all. For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Linguistic
Resource by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly
through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this
License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the
Linguistic Resource.

If any portion of this section is held invalid
or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the
section is intended to apply, and the section as a whole is intended
to apply in other circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this
section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right
claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the
sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free resource
distribution system which is implemented by public license practices.
Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of data
distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application
of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is
willing to distribute resources through any other system and a
licensee cannot impose that choice.

This section is intended to make
thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of
this License.

9. If the distribution and/or use of the Linguistic
Resource is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by
copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the
Linguistic Resource under this License may add an explicit
geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so
that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
written in the body of this License.

10. The Free Software Foundation
may publish revised and/or new versions of the Lesser General Public
License for Linguistic Resources from time to time. Such new versions
will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in
detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a
distinguishing version number. If the Linguistic Resource specifies a
version number of this License which applies to it and ""any later
version"", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation. If the Linguistic Resource does not specify a
license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
the Free Software Foundation.

11. If you wish to incorporate parts of
the Linguistic Resource into other free programs whose distribution
conditions are incompatible with these, write to the author to ask for
permission. 

 NO WARRANTY

12. BECAUSE THE LINGUISTIC RESOURCE IS
LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE LINGUISTIC
RESOURCE, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE LINGUISTIC RESOURCE ""AS IS"" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
LINGUISTIC RESOURCE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LINGUISTIC RESOURCE PROVE
DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR
CORRECTION.

13. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR
AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO
MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LINGUISTIC RESOURCE AS PERMITTED
ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL,
INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR
INABILITY TO USE THE LINGUISTIC RESOURCE (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LINGUISTIC RESOURCE TO
OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY
HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS
PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE (""AGREEMENT""). ANY
USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES
RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.

1.
DEFINITIONS

""Contribution"" means:

     a.  in the case of
<ORGANIZATION> (""<OWNER>""), the Original Program, and
     b.  in the
case of each Contributor,

          i.  changes to the Program, and
 
        ii.  additions to the Program; where such changes and/or
additions to the Program originate from and are ""Contributed"" by that
particular Contributor.

          A Contribution is ""Contributed"" by
a Contributor only (i) if it was added to the Program by such
Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf, and
(ii) the Contributor explicitly consents, in accordance with Section
3C, to characterization of the changes and/or additions as
Contributions. Contributions do not include additions to the Program
which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in conjunction
with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not
derivative works of the Program.

""Contributor"" means <OWNER> and any
other entity that has Contributed a Contribution to the
Program.

""Distributor"" means a Recipient that distributes the
Program, modifications to the Program, or any part thereof.

""Licensed
Patents"" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are
necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or
when combined with the Program.

""Original Program"" means the original
version of the software accompanying this Agreement as released by
<OWNER>, including source code, object code and documentation, if
any.

""Program"" means the Original Program and Contributions or any
part thereof

""Recipient"" means anyone who receives the Program under
this Agreement, including all Contributors.

2. GRANT OF RIGHTS

    
a. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright
license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display,
publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such
Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and
object code form.

     b. Subject to the terms of this Agreement,
each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide,
royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell,
offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such
Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. The patent
license granted by a Contributor shall also apply to the combination
of the Contribution of that Contributor and the Program if, at the
time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of
the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed
Patents. The patent license granted by a Contributor shall not apply
to (i) any other combinations which include the Contribution, nor to
(ii) Contributions of other Contributors. No hardware per se is
licensed hereunder.

     c.  Recipient understands that although each
Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein,
no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does
not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any
other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient
for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of
intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to
exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient
hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual
property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent
license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it
is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before
distributing the Program.

     d.  Each Contributor represents that
to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright rights in its
Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in this
Agreement.

3. REQUIREMENTS

     A. Distributor may choose to
distribute the Program in any form under this Agreement or under its
own license agreement, provided that:

          1.  it complies with
the terms and conditions of this Agreement;
          2.  if the
Program is distributed in source code or other tangible form, a copy
of this Agreement or Distributor's own license agreement is included
with each copy of the Program; and
          3.  if distributed under
Distributor's own license agreement, such license agreement:

        
      a.  effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all
warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties
or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or
conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;
  
            b.  effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all
liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental
and consequential damages, such as lost profits; and
               c.
 states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are
offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party.

     B.
Each Distributor must include the following in a conspicuous location
in the Program:

     Copyright (C) <YEAR>, <ORGANIZATION> and others.
All Rights Reserved.

     C. In addition, each Contributor must
identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if any, and
indicate its consent to characterization of its additions and/or
changes as a Contribution, in a manner that reasonably allows
subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.
Once consent is granted, it may not thereafter be revoked.

4.
COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION

Commercial distributors of software may
accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business
partners and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate
the commercial use of the Program, the Distributor who includes the
Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner
which does not create potential liability for Contributors. Therefore,
if a Distributor includes the Program in a commercial product
offering, such Distributor (""Commercial Distributor"") hereby agrees to
defend and indemnify every Contributor (""Indemnified Contributor"")
against any losses, damages and costs (collectively ""Losses"") arising
from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party
against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts
or omissions of such Commercial Distributor in connection with its
distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The
obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses
relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement.
In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly
notify the Commercial Distributor in writing of such claim, and b)
allow the Commercial Distributor to control, and cooperate with the
Commercial Distributor in, the defense and any related settlement
negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such
claim at its own expense.

For example, a Distributor might include
the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That
Distributor is then a Commercial Distributor. If that Commercial
Distributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties
related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such
Commercial Distributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the
Commercial Distributor would have to defend claims against the
Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and
if a court requires any Contributor to pay any damages as a result,
the Commercial Distributor must pay those damages.

5. NO
WARRANTY

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM
IS PROVIDED ON AN ""AS IS"" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF
ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY
WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY
OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely
responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and
distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its
exercise of rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to
the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable
laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and
unavailability or interruption of operations.

6. DISCLAIMER OF
LIABILITY

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER
RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY
DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL
DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED
AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY,
OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF
THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS
GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES.

7. GENERAL

If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or
unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity
or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and
without further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be
reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid
and enforceable.

If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a
Contributor with respect to a patent applicable to software (including
a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit), then any patent licenses
granted by that Contributor to such Recipient under this Agreement
shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. In addition,
if Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other
software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such
Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of
the date such litigation is filed.

All Recipient's rights under this
Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the
material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such
failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such
noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement
terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the
Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's
obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient
relating to the Program shall continue and survive.

<OWNER> may
publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time
to time. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a
distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions)
may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement
under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the
Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the
Program (including its Contributions) under the new version. No one
other than <OWNER> has the right to modify this Agreement. Except as
expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives
no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor
under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or
otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this
Agreement are reserved.

This Agreement is governed by the laws of the
State of <STATE> and the intellectual property laws of the United
States of America. No party to this Agreement will bring a legal
action under this Agreement more than one year after the cause of
action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in any
resulting litigation.

2. GRANT OF RIGHTS

     a.  Subject to the terms of
this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a
non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce,
prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform,
distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if
any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form.


    b.  Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor
hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to
sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such

license granted by a Contributor shall also apply to the combination
of the Contribution of that Contributor and the Program if, at the
time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of
the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed
Patents. The patent license granted by a Contributor shall not apply
to (i) any other combinations which include the Contribution, nor to

     c.  Recipient understands that although each
Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein,
no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM
IS PROVIDED ON AN ""AS IS"" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF
ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY
WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY
OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely
responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and
distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its
exercise of rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to
the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable
laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and
unavailability or interruption of operations.

6. DISCLAIMER OF
LIABILITY

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER
RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY
DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL
DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED
AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY,
OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF
THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS
GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES.

7. EXPORT CONTROL

Recipient agrees that Recipient alone is
responsible for compliance with the United States export
administration regulations (and the export control laws and regulation
of any other countries).

8. GENERAL

If any provision of this
Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall
not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the
terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties
hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent
necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.

If Recipient
institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with respect to a
patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or counterclaim
in a lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that Contributor to
such Recipient under this Agreement shall terminate as of the date
such litigation is filed. In addition, if Recipient institutes patent
litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim
in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations
of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes such
Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under
Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is
filed.

All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if
it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of
this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period
of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's
rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use
and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable.
However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses
granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and
survive.

LUCENT may publish new versions (including revisions) of
this Agreement from time to time. Each new version of the Agreement
will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including
Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the
Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new
version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to
distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new
version. No one other than LUCENT has the right to modify this
Agreement. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above,
Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property
of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by
implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not
expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.

This Agreement
is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the intellectual
property laws of the United States of America. No party to this
Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one
year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to
a jury trial in any resulting litigation.

à accorder la présente licence;
     « contributeur » : le

logiciel original réalisé par un licencié, autre que le logiciel ou
un logiciel modifié, qui produit ou reproduit la totalité ou une
partie importante du logiciel;

modification par un licencié de l'un des fichiers source du logiciel
ou encore tout nouveau fichier source qui incorpore le logiciel ou une
partie importante de ce dernier.

3. Licence de droit d'auteur
Sous
réserve des termes de la licence, le concédant accorde au licencié
une licence non exclusive et libre de redevances lui permettant
d’exercer les droits suivants sur le logiciel :

     1 Produire
ou reproduire la totalité ou une partie importante;
     2 Exécuter
ou représenter la totalité ou une partie importante en public;
    
3 Publier la totalité ou une partie importante;
    
4 Sous-licencier sous une autre licence libre, approuvée ou
certifiée par la Free Software Foundation ou l'Open Source
Initiative.

Cette licence est accordée sans limite territoriale et
sans limite de temps.

L'exercice complet de ces droits est sujet à
la distribution par le concédant du code source du logiciel, lequel
doit être sous une forme permettant d'y apporter des modifications.
Le concédant peut aussi distribuer le logiciel accompagné d'une
offre de distribuer le code source du logiciel, sans frais
supplémentaires, autres que ceux raisonnables afin de permettre la
livraison du code source. Cette offre doit être valide pendant une
durée raisonnable.

4. Distribution
Le licencié peut distribuer des
copies du logiciel, d'un logiciel modifié ou dérivé, sous réserve
de respecter les conditions suivantes :

     1 Le logiciel doit
être accompagné d'un exemplaire de cette licence;
     2 Si le
logiciel a été modifié, le licencié doit en faire la mention, de
préférence dans chacun des fichiers modifiés dont la nature permet
une telle mention;
     3 Les étiquettes ou mentions faisant état
des droits d'auteur, des marques de commerce, des garanties ou de la
paternité concernant le logiciel ne doivent pas être modifiées ou
supprimées, à moins que ces étiquettes ou mentions ne soient
inapplicables à un logiciel modifié ou dérivé donné.

5.
Contributions
Sous réserve d'une entente distincte, toute
contribution soumise par un contributeur au concédant pour inclusion
dans le logiciel sera soumise aux termes de cette licence.

6. Marques
de commerce
La licence n'accorde aucune permission particulière qui
permettrait d'utiliser les marques de commerce du concédant, autre
que celle requise permettant d'identifier la provenance du
logiciel.

7. Garanties
Sauf mention contraire, le concédant
distribue le logiciel sans aucune garantie, aux risques et périls de
l'acquéreur de la copie du logiciel, et ce, sans assurer que le
logiciel puisse répondre à un besoin particulier ou puisse donner un
résultat quelconque. 

Sans lier le concédant d'une quelconque
manière, rien n'empêche un licencié d'offrir ou d'exclure des
garanties ou du support.

8. Responsabilité
Le licencié est
responsable de tout préjudice résultant de l'exercice des droits
accordés par la licence. 

Le concédant ne saurait être tenu
responsable de dommages subis par le licencié ou par des tiers, pour
quelque cause que ce soit en lien avec la licence et les droits qui y
sont accordés.

9. Résiliation
La présente licence est
automatiquement résiliée dès que les droits qui y sont accordés ne
sont pas exercés conformément aux termes qui y sont
stipulés.

Toutefois, si le défaut est corrigé dans un délai de 30
jours de sa prise de connaissance par la personne en défaut, et qu'il
s'agit du premier défaut, la licence est accordée de nouveau.

Pour
tout défaut subséquent, le consentement exprès du concédant est
nécessaire afin que la licence soit accordée de nouveau.

10.
Version de la licence
Le Centre de services partagés du Québec, ses
ayants cause ou toute personne qu'il désigne, peuvent diffuser des
versions révisées ou modifiées de cette licence. Chaque version
recevra un numéro unique. Si un logiciel est déjà soumis aux termes
d'une version spécifique, c'est seulement cette version qui liera les
parties à la licence.

Le concédant peut aussi choisir de concéder
la licence sous la version actuelle ou toute version ultérieure,
auquel cas le licencié peut choisir sous quelle version la licence
lui est accordée.

11. Divers
Dans la mesure où le concédant est un
ministère, un organisme public ou une personne morale de droit
public, créés en vertu d'une loi de l'Assemblée nationale du
Québec, la licence est régie par le droit applicable au Québec et
en cas de contestation, les tribunaux du Québec seront seuls
compétents.

La présente licence peut être distribuée sans
conditions particulières. Toutefois, une version modifiée doit être
distribuée sous un nom différent. Toute référence au Centre de
services partagés du Québec, et, le cas échéant, ses ayant cause,
doit être retirée, autre que celle permettant d'identifier la
provenance de la licence.

4.1.
Réciprocité
Chaque fois que le licencié distribue le logiciel, le
concédant offre au récipiendaire une concession sur le logiciel
selon les termes de la présente licence. Le licencié doit offrir une
concession selon les termes de la présente licence pour tout logiciel
modifié qu'il distribue.

Chaque fois que le licencié distribue le
logiciel ou un logiciel modifié, ce dernier doit assumer l'obligation
d'en distribuer le code source, de la manière prévue au troisième
alinéa de l'article 3.

4.2. Compatibilité
Dans la mesure où le
licencié souhaite distribuer un logiciel modifié combiné à un
logiciel assujetti à une licence compatible, mais dont il ne serait
pas possible d'en respecter les termes, le concédant offre, en plus
de la présente concession, une concession selon les termes de cette
licence compatible.

Un licencié qui est titulaire exclusif du droit
d'auteur sur le logiciel assujetti à une licence compatible ne peut
pas se prévaloir de cette offre. Il en est de même pour toute autre
personne dûment autorisée à sous-licencier par le titulaire
exclusif du droit d'auteur sur le logiciel assujetti à une licence
compatible.

Est considérée comme une licence compatible toute
licence libre approuvée ou certifiée par la Free Software Foundation
ou l'Open Source Initiative, dont le niveau de réciprocité est
comparable ou supérieur à celui de la présente licence, sans
toutefois être moindre, notamment :

la livraison du code source. Cette offre doit être valide pendant une
durée raisonnable.

4. Distribution
Le licencié peut distribuer des
copies du logiciel, d'un logiciel modifié ou dérivé, sous réserve
de respecter les conditions suivantes :

     1 Le logiciel doit
être accompagné d'un exemplaire de cette licence;
     2 Si le
logiciel a été modifié, le licencié doit en faire la mention, de
préférence dans chacun des fichiers modifiés dont la nature permet
une telle mention;
     3 Les étiquettes ou mentions faisant état
des droits d'auteur, des marques de commerce, des garanties ou de la
paternité concernant le logiciel ne doivent pas être modifiées ou
supprimées, à moins que ces étiquettes ou mentions ne soient
inapplicables à un logiciel modifié ou dérivé donné.

4.1.
Réciprocité
Chaque fois que le licencié distribue le logiciel, le
concédant offre au récipiendaire une concession sur le logiciel
selon les termes de la présente licence. Le licencié doit offrir une
concession selon les termes de la présente licence pour tout logiciel
modifié ou dérivé qu'il distribue.

Chaque fois que le licencié
distribue le logiciel, un logiciel modifié, ou un logiciel dérivé,
ce dernier doit assumer l'obligation d'en distribuer le code source,
de la manière prévue au troisième alinéa de l'article 3.

4.2.
Compatibilité
Dans la mesure où le licencié souhaite distribuer un
logiciel modifié ou dérivé combiné à un logiciel assujetti à une
licence compatible, mais dont il ne serait pas possible d'en respecter
les termes, le concédant offre, en plus de la présente concession,
une concession selon les termes de cette licence compatible.

Un
licencié qui est titulaire exclusif du droit d'auteur sur le logiciel
assujetti à une licence compatible ne peut pas se prévaloir de cette
offre. Il en est de même pour toute autre personne dûment autorisée
à sous-licencier par le titulaire exclusif du droit d'auteur sur le
logiciel assujetti à une licence compatible.

Est considérée comme
une licence compatible toute licence libre approuvée ou certifiée
par la Free Software Foundation ou l'Open Source Initiative, dont le
niveau de réciprocité est comparable à celui de la présente
licence, sans toutefois être moindre, notamment :

     1 Common
Public License Version 1.0 (CPL-1.0)
     2 Contrat de licence de
logiciel libre CeCILL, version 2.1 (CECILL-2.1)
     3 Eclipse Public
License - v 1.0 (EPL-1.0)
     4 European Union Public License,
version 1.1 (EUPL v. 1.1)
     5 GNU General Public License Version 2
(GNU GPLv2)
     6 GNU General Public License Version 3 (GNU
GPLv3)

5. Contributions
Sous réserve d'une entente distincte, toute
contribution soumise par un contributeur au concédant pour inclusion
dans le logiciel sera soumise aux termes de cette licence.

6. Marques
de commerce
La licence n'accorde aucune permission particulière qui
permettrait d'utiliser les marques de commerce du concédant, autre
que celle requise permettant d'identifier la provenance du
logiciel.

7. Garanties
Sauf mention contraire, le concédant
distribue le logiciel sans aucune garantie, aux risques et périls de
l'acquéreur de la copie du logiciel, et ce, sans assurer que le
logiciel puisse répondre à un besoin particulier ou puisse donner un
résultat quelconque. 

Sans lier le concédant d'une quelconque
manière, rien n'empêche un licencié d'offrir ou d'exclure des
garanties ou du support.

8. Responsabilité
Le licencié est
responsable de tout préjudice résultant de l'exercice des droits
accordés par la licence.

Le concédant ne saurait être tenu
responsable du préjudice subi par le licencié ou par des tiers, pour
quelque cause que ce soit en lien avec la licence et les droits qui y
sont accordés.

9. Résiliation
La présente licence est résiliée
de plein droit dès que les droits qui y sont accordés ne sont pas
exercés conformément aux termes qui y sont stipulés.

Toutefois, si
le défaut est corrigé dans un délai de 30 jours de sa prise de
connaissance par la personne en défaut, et qu'il s'agit du premier
défaut, la licence est accordée de nouveau.

Pour tout défaut
subséquent, le consentement exprès du concédant est nécessaire
afin que la licence soit accordée de nouveau.

10. Version de la
licence
Le Centre de services partagés du Québec, ses ayants cause
ou toute personne qu'il désigne, peuvent diffuser des versions
révisées ou modifiées de cette licence. Chaque version recevra un
numéro unique. Si un logiciel est déjà soumis aux termes d'une
version spécifique, c'est seulement cette version qui liera les
parties à la licence.

Le concédant peut aussi choisir de concéder
la licence sous la version actuelle ou toute version ultérieure,
auquel cas le licencié peut choisir sous quelle version la licence
lui est accordée.

11. Divers
Dans la mesure où le concédant est un
ministère, un organisme public ou une personne morale de droit
public, créés en vertu d'une loi de l'Assemblée nationale du
Québec, la licence est régie par le droit applicable au Québec et
en cas de contestation, les tribunaux du Québec seront seuls
compétents.

La présente licence peut être distribuée sans
conditions particulières. Toutefois, une version modifiée doit être
distribuée sous un nom différent. Toute référence au Centre de
services partagés du Québec, et, le cas échéant, ses ayant cause,
doit être retirée, autre que celle permettant d'identifier la
provenance de la licence.

apt for any kind of work (such as source code, fonts, documentation,

is asserted unless advertising clauses are used. The MirOS Licence is

We believe you are not
liable for work inserted which is intellectual property of third
parties, if you were not aware of the fact, act appropriately as soon
as you become aware of that problem, seek an amicable solution for all
parties, and never knowingly distribute a work without being
authorised to do so by its licensors.

Historical Background

This edition of the Multics
software materials and documentation is provided and donated to
Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Group BULL including BULL HN
Information Systems Inc. as a contribution to computer science
knowledge. This donation is made also to give evidence of the common
contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Bell
Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc.,
Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL and BULL HN Information Systems Inc.
to the development of this operating system. Multics development was
initiated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project MAC
(1963-1970), renamed the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and
Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s, under the leadership of
Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users consider that Multics provided
the best software architecture for managing computer hardware properly
and for executing programs. Many subsequent operating systems
incorporated Multics principles. Multics was distributed in 1975 to
2000 by Group Bull in Europe , and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information
Systems Inc., as successor in interest by change in name only to
Honeywell Bull Inc. and Honeywell Information Systems Inc.
.

THIS OPEN SOURCE AGREEMENT
(""AGREEMENT"") DEFINES THE RIGHTS OF USE, REPRODUCTION, DISTRIBUTION,
MODIFICATION AND REDISTRIBUTION OF CERTAIN COMPUTER SOFTWARE
ORIGINALLY RELEASED BY THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT AS REPRESENTED BY
THE GOVERNMENT AGENCY LISTED BELOW (""GOVERNMENT AGENCY""). THE UNITED
STATES GOVERNMENT, AS REPRESENTED BY GOVERNMENT AGENCY, IS AN INTENDED
THIRD-PARTY BENEFICIARY OF ALL SUBSEQUENT DISTRIBUTIONS OR
REDISTRIBUTIONS OF THE SUBJECT SOFTWARE. ANYONE WHO USES, REPRODUCES,
DISTRIBUTES, MODIFIES OR REDISTRIBUTES THE SUBJECT SOFTWARE, AS
DEFINED HEREIN, OR ANY PART THEREOF, IS, BY THAT ACTION, ACCEPTING IN
FULL THE RESPONSIBILITIES AND OBLIGATIONS CONTAINED IN THIS
AGREEMENT.

Software, or portions thereof, with software separate from the Subject
Software that is not governed by the terms of this Agreement. F.
""Modification"" means any alteration of, including addition to or
deletion from, the substance or structure of either the Original
Software or Subject Software, and includes derivative works, as that
term is defined in the Copyright Statute, 17 USC 101. However, the act
of including Subject Software as part of a Larger Work does not in and
of itself constitute a Modification. G. ""Original Software"" means the
computer software first released under this Agreement by Government
Agency with Government Agency designation __ and entitled _________,
including source code, object code and accompanying documentation, if
any. H. ""Recipient"" means anyone who acquires the Subject Software
under this Agreement, including all Contributors. I. ""Redistribution""

C.
Each Contributor must characterize its alteration of the Subject
Software as a Modification and must identify itself as the originator
of its Modification in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent
Recipients to identify the originator of the Modification. In
fulfillment of these requirements, Contributor must include a file
(e.g., a change log file) that describes the alterations made and the
date of the alterations, identifies Contributor as originator of the
alterations, and consents to characterization of the alterations as a
Modification, for example, by including a statement that the
Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original
Software provided by Government Agency. Once consent is granted, it
may not thereafter be revoked.

Recipient makes a Modification available, it is requested that the
Recipient inform Government Agency, by e-mail to the Government Agency
Point of Contact listed in clause 5.F., how to access the
Modification.

G. Each Contributor represents that that its
Modification is believed to be Contributor's original creation and
does not violate any existing agreements, regulations, statutes or
rules, and further that Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the
rights conveyed by this Agreement.

H. A Recipient may choose to
offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity and/or
liability obligations to one or more other Recipients of the Subject
Software. A Recipient may do so, however, only on its own behalf and
not on behalf of Government Agency or any other Recipient. Such a
Recipient must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty,
support, indemnity and/or liability obligation is offered by that
Recipient alone. Further, such Recipient agrees to indemnify
Government Agency and every other Recipient for any liability incurred
by them as a result of warranty, support, indemnity and/or liability
offered by such Recipient.

I. A Recipient may create a Larger Work by
combining Subject Software with separate software not governed by the

product. In such case, the Recipient must make sure Subject Software,
or portions thereof, included in the Larger Work is subject to this
Agreement.

J. Notwithstanding any provisions contained herein,
Recipient is hereby put on notice that export of any goods or
technical data from the United States may require some form of export
license from the U.S. Government. Failure to obtain necessary export
licenses may result in criminal liability under U.S. laws. Government
Agency neither represents that a license shall not be required nor
that, if required, it shall be issued. Nothing granted herein provides
any such export license.

DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES AND LIABILITIES;
WAIVER AND INDEMNIFICATION

A. No Warranty: THE SUBJECT SOFTWARE IS
PROVIDED ""AS IS"" WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED,

Rights Reserved.

Note: This license is derived from the ""Artistic
License"" as distributed with the Perl Programming Language. Its terms
are different from those of the ""Artistic License."" 

PREAMBLE

The
intent of this document is to state the conditions under which a
Package may be copied, such that the Copyright Holder maintains some
semblance of artistic control over the development of the package,
while giving the users of the package the right to use and distribute
the Package in a more-or-less customary fashion, plus the right to
make reasonable modifications.

Definitions:

     ""Package"" refers to
the collection of files distributed by the Copyright Holder, and
derivatives of that collection of files created through textual
modification.

     ""Standard Version"" refers to such a Package if it
has not been modified, or has been modified in accordance with the
wishes of the Copyright Holder.

     ""Copyright Holder"" is whoever is
named in the copyright or copyrights for the package.

     ""You"" is
you, if you're thinking about copying or distributing this Package.

 
   ""Reasonable copying fee"" is whatever you can justify on the basis
of media cost, duplication charges, time of people involved, and so
on. (You will not be required to justify it to the Copyright Holder,
but only to the computing community at large as a market that must
bear the fee.)

     ""Freely Available"" means that no fee is charged
for the item itself, though there may be fees involved in handling the
item. It also means that recipients of the item may redistribute it
under the same conditions they received it.

1. You may make and give
away verbatim copies of the source form of the Standard Version of
this Package without restriction, provided that you duplicate all of
the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.

2. You may
apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications derived
from the Public Domain or from the Copyright Holder. A Package
modified in such a way shall still be considered the Standard
Version.

3. You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any
way, provided that you insert a prominent notice in each changed file
stating how and when you changed that file, and provided that you do
at least ONE of the following:

     a) place your modifications in
the Public Domain or otherwise make them Freely Available, such as by
posting said modifications to Usenet or an equivalent medium, or
placing the modifications on a major archive site such as
uunet.uu.net, or by allowing the Copyright Holder to include your
modifications in the Standard Version of the Package.

     b) use the
modified Package only within your corporation or organization.

    
c) rename any non-standard executables so the names do not conflict
with standard executables, which must also be provided, and provide a
separate manual page for each non-standard executable that clearly
documents how it differs from the Standard Version.

     d) make
other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.

4. You may
distribute the programs of this Package in object code or executable
form, provided that you do at least ONE of the following:

     a)
distribute a Standard Version of the executables and library files,
together with instructions (in the manual page or equivalent) on where
to get the Standard Version.

     b) accompany the distribution with
the machine-readable source of the Package with your modifications.

 
   c) accompany any non-standard executables with their corresponding
Standard Version executables, giving the non-standard executables
non-standard names, and clearly documenting the differences in manual
pages (or equivalent), together with instructions on where to get the
Standard Version.

     d) make other distribution arrangements with
the Copyright Holder.

5. You may charge a reasonable copying fee for
any distribution of this Package. You may charge any fee you choose
for support of this Package. You may not charge a fee for this Package
itself. However, you may distribute this Package in aggregate with
other (possibly commercial) programs as part of a larger (possibly
commercial) software distribution provided that you do not advertise
this Package as a product of your own.

6. The scripts and library
files supplied as input to or produced as output from the programs of
this Package do not automatically fall under the copyright of this
Package, but belong to whomever generated them, and may be sold
commercially, and may be aggregated with this Package.

7. C
subroutines supplied by you and linked into this Package in order to
emulate subroutines and variables of the language defined by this
Package shall not be considered part of this Package, but are the
equivalent of input as in Paragraph 6, provided these subroutines do
not change the language in any way that would cause it to fail the
regression tests for the language.

8. The name of the Copyright
Holder may not be used to endorse or promote products derived from
this software without specific prior written permission.

9. THIS
PACKAGE IS PROVIDED ""AS IS"" AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED
WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTIBILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

(Copyright 1989 M. Stephenson) 
(Based
on the BISON general public license, copyright 1988 Richard M.
Stallman)

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim
copies of this license, but changing it is not allowed. You can also
use this wording to make the terms for other programs.

The license
agreements of most software companies keep you at the mercy of those
companies. By contrast, our general public license is intended to give
everyone the right to share NetHack. To make sure that you get the
rights we want you to have, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
Hence this license agreement.

Specifically, we want to make sure that
you have the right to give away copies of NetHack, that you receive
source code or else can get it if you want it, that you can change
NetHack or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know
you can do these things.

To make sure that everyone has such rights,
we have to forbid you to deprive anyone else of these rights. For
example, if you distribute copies of NetHack, you must give the
recipients all the rights that you have. You must make sure that they,
too, receive or can get the source code. And you must tell them their
rights.

Also, for our own protection, we must make certain that
everyone finds out that there is no warranty for NetHack. If NetHack
is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to
know that what they have is not what we distributed.

Therefore we
(Mike Stephenson and other holders of NetHack copyrights) make the
following terms which say what you must do to be allowed to distribute
or change NetHack.

COPYING POLICIES

You may copy and distribute
verbatim copies of NetHack source code as you receive it, in any
medium, provided that you keep intact the notices on all files that
refer to copyrights, to this License Agreement, and to the absence of
any warranty; and give any other recipients of the NetHack program a
copy of this License Agreement along with the program.

You may modify
your copy or copies of NetHack or any portion of it, and copy and
distribute such modifications under the terms of Paragraph 1 above
(including distributing this License Agreement), provided that you
also do the following:

     a) cause the modified files to carry
prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of
any change; and

     b) cause the whole of any work that you
distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is a
derivative of NetHack or any part thereof, to be licensed at no charge
to all third parties on terms identical to those contained in this
License Agreement (except that you may choose to grant more extensive
warranty protection to some or all third parties, at your option)

   
 c) You may charge a distribution fee for the physical act of
transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty
protection in exchange for a fee.

You may copy and distribute NetHack
(or a portion or derivative of it, under Paragraph 2) in object code
or executable form under the terms of Paragraphs 1 and 2 above
provided that you also do one of the following:

     a) accompany it
with the complete machine-readable source code, which must be
distributed under the terms of Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,

     b)
accompany it with full information as to how to obtain the complete
machine-readable source code from an appropriate archive site. (This
alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution.)

For
these purposes, complete source code means either the full source
distribution as originally released over Usenet or updated copies of
the files in this distribution used to create the object code or
executable.

You may not copy, sublicense, distribute or transfer
NetHack except as expressly provided under this License Agreement. Any
attempt otherwise to copy, sublicense, distribute or transfer NetHack
is void and your rights to use the program under this License
agreement shall be automatically terminated. However, parties who have
received computer software programs from you with this License
Agreement will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.
Stated plainly: You are permitted
to modify NetHack, or otherwise use parts of NetHack, provided that
you comply with the conditions specified above; in particular, your
modified NetHack or program containing parts of NetHack must remain
freely available as provided in this License Agreement. In other
words, go ahead and share NetHack, but don't try to stop anyone else
from sharing it farther.

Preface of
licence

This licence grants you the right to copy, use and distribute
information, provided you acknowledge the contributors and comply with
the terms and conditions stipulated in this licence. By using
information made available under this licence, you accept the terms
and conditions set forth in this licence. As set out in Section 7, the
licensor disclaims any and all liability for the quality of the
information and what the information is used for.

This licence shall
not impose any limitations on the rights or freedoms of the licensee
under the Norwegian Freedom of Information Act or any other
legislation granting the general public a right of access to public
sector information, or that follow from exemptions or limitations
stipulated in the Norwegian Copyright Act. Further, the licence shall
not impose any limitations on the licensee's freedom of expression
recognized by law.

1. Definitions
     
     «Database» shall mean
a database or similar protected under Section 43 of the Norwegian
Copyright Act.
     «Information» shall mean texts, images,
recordings, data sets or other works protected under Section 1 of the
Norwegian Copyright Act, or which are protected under provisions
addressing what is referred to as «neighbouring rights» in Chapter 5
of the Norwegian Copyright Act (including databases and photographs),
and which are distributed under this licence.
     «Copy» shall mean
reproduction in any form.
     «Licensee» and «you» shall mean
natural or legal persons using information under this licence.
    
«Licensor» shall mean the natural or legal person that makes
information available under this licence.
     «Distribute» shall
mean any actions whereby information is made available, including to
distribute, transfer, communicate, disperse, show, perform, sell, lend
and rent.
     «Use» shall mean one or more actions relevant to
copyright law requiring permission from the owner of the
copyright.
	
2. Licence
The licensee, subject to the limitations that
follow from this licence, may use the information for any purpose and
in all contexts, by:

     * copying the information and distributing
the information to others,
     * modifying the information and/or
combining the information with other information, and
     * copying
and distributing such changed or combined information.
     * This is
a non-exclusive, free, perpetual and worldwide licence. The
information may be used in any medium and format known today and/or
which will become known in the future. The Licensee shall not
sub-license or transfer this licence.

3. Exemptions
The licence does
not apply to and therefore does not grant a right to use:

     *
information which contains personal data covered by the Norwegian
Personal Data Act unless there is a legitimate basis for the
disclosure and further processing of the personal data
     *
information distributed in violation of a statutory obligation to
observe confidentiality
     * information excluded from public
disclosure pursuant to law, including information deemed sensitive
under the Norwegian National Security Act
     * information subject
to third party rights which the licensor is not authorised to license
to the licensee
     * information protected by intellectual property
rights other than copyright and neighbouring rights in accordance with
Chapter 5 of the Norwegian Copyright Act, such as trademarks, patents
and design rights, but this does not entail an impediment to use
information where the licensor's logo has been permanently integrated
into the information or to attribute the origin of the information in
accordance with the article below relating to attribution.

If the
licensor has made available information not covered by the licence
according to the above list, the licensee must cease all use of the
information under the licence, and erase the information as soon as he
or she becomes aware of or should have understood that the information
is not covered by the licence.

4. Effects of breach of the
licence
The licence is subject to the licensee's compliance with the
terms and conditions of this licence. In the event that the licensee
commits a breach of this licence, this will entail that the licensee's
right to use the information will be revoked immediately without
further notice. In case of such a breach, the licensee must
immediately and without further notice take measures to cause the
infringement to end. Because the right to use the information has been
terminated, the licensee must cease all use of the information by
virtue of the licence.

5. Attribution
The licensee shall attribute
the licensor as specified by the licensor and include a reference to
this licence. To the extent practically possible, the licensee shall
provide a link to both this licence and the source of the
information.

If the licensor has not specified how attributions shall
be made, the licensee shall normally state the following: «Contains
data under the Norwegian licence for Open Government data (NLOD)
distributed by [name of licensor]».

If the licensor has specified
that the information shall only be available under a specific version
of this licence, cf. Section 10, the licensee shall also state
this.

If the information has been changed, the licensee must clearly
indicate that changes have been made by the licensee.

6. Proper
use
The licensee shall not use the information in a manner that
appears misleading nor present the information in a distorted or
incorrect manner.
Neither the licensor's nor other contributors' names
or trademarks must be used to support, recommend or market the
licensee or any products or services using the information.

7.
Disclaimer of liability
The information is licensed «as is». The
information may contain errors and omissions. The licensor provides no
warranties, including relating to the content and relevance of the
information.

The licensor disclaims any liability for errors and
defects associated with the information to the maximum extent
permitted by law.

The licensor shall not be liable for direct or
indirect losses as a result of use of the information or in connection
with copying or further distribution of the information.

8.
Guarantees regarding data quality and accessibility
This licence does
not prevent the licensor from issuing supplementary statements
regarding expected or intended data quality and accessibility. Such
statements shall be regarded as indicative in nature and not binding
on the part of the licensor. The disclaimers in Section 7 also apply
in full for such indicative statements. Based on separate agreement,
the licensor may provide guarantees and distribute the information on
terms and conditions different from those set forth in this
licence.

9. Licence compatibility
If the licensee is to distribute an
adapted or combined work based on information covered by this licence
and some other work licensed under a licence compatible by contract,
such distribution may be based on an appropriate licence compatible by
contract, cf. the list below.

A licence compatible by contract shall
mean the following licences:

     * for all information: Open
Government Licence (version 1.0),
     * for those parts of the
information which do not constitute databases: Creative Commons
Attribution Licence (generic version 1.0, 2.0, 2.5 and unported
version 3.0) and Creative Commons Navngivelse 3.0 Norge,
     * for
those parts of the information which constitute databases: Open Data
Commons Attribution License (version 1.0).

This provision does not
prevent other licences from being compatible with this licence based
on their content.

10. New versions of the licence
The licensee may
choose to use the information covered by this licence under any new
versions of the Norwegian licence for Open Government data (NLOD)
issued by the responsible ministry (currently the Ministry of
Government Administration, Reform and Church Affairs) when these
versions are final and official, unless the licensor when making the
information available under this licence specifically has stated that
solely version 1.0 of this licence may be used.

11. Governing law and
legal venue
This licence, including its formation, and any disputes
and claims arising in connection with or relating to this licence,
shall be regulated by Norwegian law. The legal venue shall be the
licensor's ordinary legal venue. The licensor may, with regard to
intellectual proprietary rights, choose to pursue a claim at other
competent legal venues and/or based on the laws of the country where
the intellectual property rights are sought enforced.

portions thereof), but solely to the extent that any such patent is
reasonably necessary to enable You to Utilize the Contributor Version
(or portions thereof), and not to any greater extent that may be
necessary to Utilize further Modifications or combinations.

3.
Distribution Obligations.
	
     3.1. Application of License. The
Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are governed
by the terms of this License, including without limitation Section
2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be distributed only
under the terms of this License or a future version of this License
released under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of this
License with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not
offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or
restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients'
rights hereunder. However, You may include an additional document
offering the additional rights described in Section 3.5.

     3.2.
Availability of Source Code. Any Modification which You create or to
which You contribute must be made available in Source Code form under
the terms of this License either on the same media as an Executable
version or via an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone
to whom you made an Executable version available; and if made
available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must remain available
for at least twelve (12) months after the date it initially became
available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent version of
that particular Modification has been made available to such
recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code
version remains available even if the Electronic Distribution
Mechanism is maintained by a third party. 

     3.3. Description of
Modifications. You must cause all Covered Code to which you contribute
to contain a file documenting the changes You made to create that
Covered Code and the date of any change. You must include a prominent
statement that the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly,
from Original Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the
name of the Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any
notice in an Executable version or related documentation in which You
describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Code. 

     3.4.
Intellectual Property Matters
          (a) Third Party Claims. If You
have knowledge that a party claims an intellectual property right in
particular functionality or code (or its utilization under this
License), you must include a text file with the source code
distribution titled ``LEGAL'' which describes the claim and the party
making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom
to contact. If you obtain such knowledge after You make Your
Modification available as described in Section 3.2, You shall promptly
modify the LEGAL file in all copies You make available thereafter and
shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or
newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the
Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.
          (b)
Contributor APIs. If Your Modification is an application programming
interface and You own or control patents which are reasonably
necessary to implement that API, you must also include this
information in the LEGAL file.
	
     3.5. Required Notices. You must
duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code, and
this License in any documentation for the Source Code, where You
describe recipients' rights relating to Covered Code. If You created
one or more Modification(s), You may add your name as a Contributor to
the notice described in Exhibit A. If it is not possible to put such
notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then you
must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory
file) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice. You may
choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity
or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code.
However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of
the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely
clear than any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability
obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify
the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred
by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty,
support, indemnity or liability terms You offer. 

     3.6.
Distribution of Executable Versions. You may distribute Covered Code
in Executable form only if the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have
been met for that Covered Code, and if You include a notice stating
that the Source Code version of the Covered Code is available under
the terms of this License, including a description of how and where
You have fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be
conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable version, related
documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients' rights
relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable
version of Covered Code under a license of Your choice, which may
contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in
compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the
Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's
rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this
License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different
license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ
from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial
Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the
Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by
the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such
terms You offer. 

     3.7. Larger Works. You may create a Larger
Work by combining Covered Code with other code not governed by the
terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single
product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this
License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.

4. Inability to Comply
Due to Statute or Regulation.
If it is impossible for You to comply
with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of
the Covered Code due to statute or regulation then You must: (a)
comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible;
and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such
description must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section
3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code.
Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such
description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary
skill to be able to understand it.

5. Application of this
License.
This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer
has attached the notice in Exhibit A, and to related Covered Code.

6.
Versions of the License.
     6.1. New Versions. Netscape
Communications Corporation (``Netscape'') may publish revised and/or
new versions of the License from time to time. Each version will be
given a distinguishing version number.
	
     6.2. Effect of New
Versions. Once Covered Code has been published under a particular
version of the License, You may always continue to use it under the
terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code
under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by
Netscape. No one other than Netscape has the right to modify the terms
applicable to Covered Code created under this License. 
		
     6.3.
Derivative Works. If you create or use a modified version of this
License (which you may only do in order to apply it to code which is
not already Covered Code governed by this License), you must (a)
rename Your license so that the phrases ``Mozilla'', ``MOZILLAPL'',
``MOZPL'', ``Netscape'', ``NPL'' or any confusingly similar phrase do
not appear anywhere in your license and (b) otherwise make it clear
that your version of the license contains terms which differ from the
Mozilla Public License and Netscape Public License. (Filling in the
name of the Initial Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the
notice described in Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be
modifications of this License.)

7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.

COVERED
CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN ``AS IS'' BASIS, WITHOUT
WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS,
MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE
ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS
WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU
(NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST
OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF
WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY
COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

8.
TERMINATION.

This License and the rights granted hereunder will
terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and
fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the
breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted
shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by
their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this
License shall survive.

9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

UNDER NO
CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING
NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY
OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER
OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY OTHER PERSON FOR ANY
INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY
CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL,
WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER
COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN
INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF
LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY
RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW
PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE
EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO
THAT EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

10. U.S.
GOVERNMENT END USERS.

The Covered Code is a ``commercial item,'' as
that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of
``commercial computer software'' and ``commercial computer software
documentation,'' as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept.
1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1
through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire
Covered Code with only those rights set forth herein.

11.
MISCELLANEOUS.

This License represents the complete agreement
concerning subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is
held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the
extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be
governed by California law provisions (except to the extent applicable
law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law
provisions. With respect to disputes in which at least one party is a
citizen of, or an entity chartered or registered to do business in,

AMENDMENTS
Additional Terms applicable to the Netscape Public
License.

     I. Effect.  
These additional terms described in this
Netscape Public License -- Amendments shall apply to the Mozilla
Communicator client code and to all Covered Code under this
License. 

     II. ``Netscape's Branded Code'' means Covered Code
that Netscape distributes and/or permits others to distribute under
one or more trademark(s) which are controlled by Netscape but which
are not licensed for use under this License. 

     III. Netscape and
logo.  
     This License does not grant any rights to use the
trademark ``Netscape'', the ``Netscape N and horizon'' logo or the
Netscape lighthouse logo, even if such marks are included in the
Original Code. 

     IV. Inability to Comply Due to Contractual
Obligation.  
     Prior to licensing the Original Code under this
License, Netscape has licensed third party code for use in Netscape's
Branded Code. To the extent that Netscape is limited contractually
from making such third party code available under this License,
Netscape may choose to reintegrate such code into Covered Code without
being required to distribute such code in 
Source Code form, even if
such code would otherwise be considered ``Modifications'' under this
License. 

     V. Use of Modifications and Covered Code by Initial
Developer.
          V.1. In General. The obligations of Section 3
apply to Netscape, except to the extent specified in this Amendment,
Section V.2 and V.3. 
          V.2. Other Products. Netscape may
include Covered Code in products other than the Netscape's Branded
Code which are released by Netscape during the two (2) years following
the release date of the Original Code, without such additional
products becoming subject to the terms of this License, and may
license such additional products on different terms from those
contained in this License. 
          V.3. Alternative Licensing.
Netscape may license the Source Code of Netscape's Branded Code,
including Modifications incorporated therein, without such additional
products becoming subject to the terms of this License, and may
license such additional products on different terms from those
contained in this License.
	
     VI. Arbitration and Litigation.  
 
   Notwithstanding the limitations of Section 11 above, the provisions
regarding arbitration and litigation in Section 11(a), (b) and (c) of
the License shall apply to all disputes relating to this
License.

Covered Software in the absence of Modifications made by that
Contributor.

3. DISTRIBUTION OBLIGATIONS.

     3.1 Application of
License. 
     The Modifications which You create or to which You
contribute are governed by the terms of this License, including
without limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered
Software may be distributed only under the terms of this License or a
future version of this License released under Section 6.1, and You
must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code
You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source
Code version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this
License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include
an additional document offering the additional rights described in
Section 3.5.

     3.2 Availability of Source Code.
     Any
Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be made
available in Source Code form under the terms of this License either
on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted
Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an
Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic
Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12)
months after the date it initially became available, or at least six
(6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification
has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for
ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the
Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.

   
 3.3 Description of Modifications.
     You must cause all Covered
Software to which You contribute to contain a file documenting the
changes You made to create that Covered Software and the date of any
change. You must include a prominent statement that the Modification
is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Software provided by
Nokia and including the name of Nokia in (a) the Source Code, and (b)
in any notice in an Executable version or related documentation in
which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Software.

 
   3.4 Intellectual Property Matters

          (a) Third Party
Claims. If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third
party's intellectual property rights is required to exercise the
rights granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2,
Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code distribution
titled ""LEGAL"" which describes the claim and the party making the
claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact.
If Contributor obtains such knowledge after the Modification is made
available as described in Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly
modify the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor makes available
thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate
mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who
received the Covered Software that new knowledge has been obtained.

 
        (b) Contributor APIs. If Contributor's Modifications include
an application programming interface and Contributor has knowledge of
patent licenses which are reasonably necessary to implement that API,
Contributor must also include this information in the LEGAL file.

   
      (c) Representations. Contributor represents that, except as
disclosed pursuant to Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that
Contributor's Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s)
and/or Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed
by this License.

     3.5 Required Notices.
     You must duplicate
the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code. If it is not
possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to
its structure, then You must include such notice in a location (such
as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely to look for such
a notice. If You created one or more Modification(s) You may add your
name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. You must
also duplicate this License in any documentation for the Source Code
where You describe recipients' rights or ownership rights relating to
Covered Software. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for,
warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more
recipients of Covered Software. However, You may do so only on Your
own behalf, and not on behalf of Nokia or any Contributor. You must
make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or
liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to
indemnify Nokia and every Contributor for any liability incurred by
Nokia or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity
or liability terms You offer.

     3.6 Distribution of Executable
Versions.
     You may distribute Covered Software in Executable form
only if the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that
Covered Software, and if You include a notice stating that the Source
Code version of the Covered Software is available under the terms of
this License, including a description of how and where You have
fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be
conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable version, related
documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients' rights
relating to the Covered Software. You may distribute the Executable
version of Covered Software or ownership rights under a license of
Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License,
provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and
that the license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit
or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code version from the
rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable
version under a different license You must make it absolutely clear
that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You
alone, not by Nokia or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify
Nokia and every Contributor for any liability incurred by Nokia or
such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.

     3.7
Larger Works.
     You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered
Software with other software not governed by the terms of this License
and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case,
You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for
the Covered Software.

4. INABILITY TO COMPLY DUE TO STATUTE OR
REGULATION.
If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the
terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered
Software due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must:
(a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent
possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect.
Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described in
Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the Source
Code.

Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such
description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary
skill to be able to understand it.

5. APPLICATION OF THIS
LICENSE.
This License applies to code to which Nokia has attached the
notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Software.

6. VERSIONS OF
THE LICENSE. 

     6.1 New Versions.
     Nokia may publish revised
and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version
will be given a distinguishing version number.

     6.2 Effect of New
Versions.
     Once Covered Software has been published under a
particular version of the License, You may always continue to use it
under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such
Covered Software under the terms of any subsequent version of the
License published by Nokia. No one other than Nokia has the right to
modify the terms applicable to Covered Software created under this
License.

7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.
COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED
UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN ""AS IS"" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES
THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE
QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD
ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT NOKIA,
ITS LICENSORS OR AFFILIATES OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST
OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF
WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY
COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS
DISCLAIMER.

8. TERMINATION.

     8.1 This License and the rights
granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply
with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of
becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Software
which are properly granted shall survive any termination of this
License. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect
beyond the termination of this License shall survive.

     8.2 If You
initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim
(excluding declatory judgment actions) against Nokia or a Contributor
(Nokia or Contributor against whom You file such action is referred to
as ""Participant"") alleging that:

          a) such Participant's
Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then
any and all rights granted by such Participant to You under Sections
2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from
Participant terminate prospectively, unless if within 60 days after
receipt of notice You either: (i) agree in writing to pay Participant
a mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and future use
of Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your
litigation claim with respect to the Contributor Version against such
Participant. If within 60 days of notice, a reasonable royalty and
payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the
parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted
by Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically
terminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice period specified
above.

          b) any software, hardware, or device, other than
such Participant's Contributor Version, directly or indirectly
infringes any patent, then any rights granted to You by such
Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as
of the date You first made, used, sold, distributed, or had made,
Modifications made by that Participant.

     8.3 If You assert a
patent infringement claim against Participant alleging that such
Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any
patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement)
prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the
reasonable value of the licenses granted by such Participant under
Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the
amount or value of any payment or license.

     8.4 In the event of
termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all end user license
agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been
validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to
termination shall survive termination.

9. LIMITATION OF
LIABILITY.
UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER
TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, NOKIA,
ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY
SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY
INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY
CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL,
WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER
COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN
INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF
LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY
RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW
PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE
EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, BUT
MAY ALLOW LIABILITY TO BE LIMITED; IN SUCH CASES, A PARTY's, ITS
EMPLOYEES, LICENSORS OR AFFILIATES' LIABILITY SHALL BE LIMITED TO U.S.
$50. Nothing contained in this License shall prejudice the statutory
rights of any party dealing as a consumer.

10. MISCELLANEOUS.
This
License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter
hereof. All rights in the Covered Software not expressly granted under
this License are reserved. Nothing in this License shall grant You any
rights to use any of the trademarks of Nokia or any of its Affiliates,
even if any of such trademarks are included in any part of Covered
Software and/or documentation to it.

This License is governed by the
laws of Finland excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. All disputes
arising from or relating to this Agreement shall be settled by a
single arbitrator appointed by the Central Chamber of Commerce of
Finland. The arbitration procedure shall take place in Helsinki,
Finland in the English language. If any part of this Agreement is
found void and unenforceable, it will not affect the validity of the
balance of the Agreement, which shall remain valid and enforceable
according to its terms.

11. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.
As between
Nokia and the Contributors, each party is responsible for claims and
damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of
rights under this License and You agree to work with Nokia and
Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis.
Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any
admission of liability.

provision of the License will be enforced to the maximum extent
permissible so as to effect the economic benefits and intent of the
parties, and the remainder of this License will continue in full force
and extent.

Preamble

The Open Database License
(ODbL) is a license agreement intended to allow users to freely share,
modify, and use this Database while maintaining this same freedom for
others. Many databases are covered by copyright, and therefore this
document licenses these rights. Some jurisdictions, mainly in the
European Union, have specific rights that cover databases, and so the
ODbL addresses these rights, too. Finally, the ODbL is also an
agreement in contract for users of this Database to act in certain
ways in return for accessing this Database.

Databases can contain a
wide variety of types of content (images, audiovisual material, and
sounds all in the same database, for example), and so the ODbL only
governs the rights over the Database, and not the contents of the
Database individually. Licensors should use the ODbL together with
another license for the contents, if the contents have a single set of
rights that uniformly covers all of the contents. If the contents have
multiple sets of different rights, Licensors should describe what
rights govern what contents together in the individual record or in
some other way that clarifies what rights apply. 

Sometimes the
contents of a database, or the database itself, can be covered by
other rights not addressed here (such as private contracts, trade mark
over the name, or privacy rights / data protection rights over
information in the contents), and so you are advised that you may have
to consult other documents or clear other rights before doing
activities not covered by this License.

------

The Licensor (as
defined below) 

and 

You (as defined below) 

agree as follows:


1.0 Definitions of Capitalised Words

""Collective Database"" –
Means this Database in unmodified form as part of a collection of
independent databases in themselves that together are assembled into a
collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collective Database will
not be considered a Derivative Database.

""Convey"" – As a verb,
means Using the Database, a Derivative Database, or the Database as
part of a Collective Database in any way that enables a Person to make
or receive copies of the Database or a Derivative Database. Conveying
does not include interaction with a user through a computer network,
or creating and Using a Produced Work, where no transfer of a copy of
the Database or a Derivative Database occurs. ""Contents"" – The
contents of this Database, which includes the information, independent
works, or other material collected into the Database. For example, the
contents of the Database could be factual data or works such as
images, audiovisual material, text, or sounds.

""Database"" – A
collection of material (the Contents) arranged in a systematic or
methodical way and individually accessible by electronic or other
means offered under the terms of this License.

""Database Directive""
– Means Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the
Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, as
amended or succeeded.

""Database Right"" – Means rights resulting
from the Chapter III (""sui generis"") rights in the Database Directive
(as amended and as transposed by member states), which includes the
Extraction and Re-utilisation of the whole or a Substantial part of
the Contents, as well as any similar rights available in the relevant
jurisdiction under Section 10.4. 

""Derivative Database"" – Means a
database based upon the Database, and includes any translation,
adaptation, arrangement, modification, or any other alteration of the
Database or of a Substantial part of the Contents. This includes, but
is not limited to, Extracting or Re-utilising the whole or a
Substantial part of the Contents in a new Database.

""Extraction"" –
Means the permanent or temporary transfer of all or a Substantial part
of the Contents to another medium by any means or in any
form.

""License"" – Means this license agreement and is both a
license of rights such as copyright and Database Rights and an
agreement in contract.

""Licensor"" – Means the Person that offers
the Database under the terms of this License. 

""Person"" – Means a
natural or legal person or a body of persons corporate or
incorporate.

""Produced Work"" – a work (such as an image,
audiovisual material, text, or sounds) resulting from using the whole
or a Substantial part of the Contents (via a search or other query)
from this Database, a Derivative Database, or this Database as part of
a Collective Database. 

""Publicly"" – means to Persons other than
You or under Your control by either more than 50% ownership or by the
power to direct their activities (such as contracting with an
independent consultant). 

""Re-utilisation"" – means any form of
making available to the public all or a Substantial part of the
Contents by the distribution of copies, by renting, by online or other
forms of transmission.

""Substantial"" – Means substantial in terms
of quantity or quality or a combination of both. The repeated and
systematic Extraction or Re-utilisation of insubstantial parts of the
Contents may amount to the Extraction or Re-utilisation of a
Substantial part of the Contents.

""Use"" – As a verb, means doing
any act that is restricted by copyright or Database Rights whether in
the original medium or any other; and includes without limitation
distributing, copying, publicly performing, publicly displaying, and
preparing derivative works of the Database, as well as modifying the
Database as may be technically necessary to use it in a different mode
or format. 

""You"" – Means a Person exercising rights under this
License who has not previously violated the terms of this License with
respect to the Database, or who has received express permission from
the Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a previous
violation.

Words in the singular include the plural and vice
versa.

2.0 What this License covers

2.1. Legal effect of this
document. This License is:

     a. A license of applicable copyright
and neighbouring rights;

     b. A license of the Database Right;
and

     c. An agreement in contract between You and the
Licensor.

2.2 Legal rights covered. This License covers the legal
rights in the Database, including:

     a. Copyright. Any copyright
or neighbouring rights in the Database. The copyright licensed
includes any individual elements of the Database, but does not cover
the copyright over the Contents independent of this Database. See
Section 2.4 for details. Copyright law varies between jurisdictions,
but is likely to cover: the Database model or schema, which is the
structure, arrangement, and organisation of the Database, and can also
include the Database tables and table indexes; the data entry and
output sheets; and the Field names of Contents stored in the
Database;

     b. Database Rights. Database Rights only extend to the
Extraction and Re-utilisation of the whole or a Substantial part of
the Contents. Database Rights can apply even when there is no
copyright over the Database. Database Rights can also apply when the
Contents are removed from the Database and are selected and arranged
in a way that would not infringe any applicable copyright; and

    
c. Contract. This is an agreement between You and the Licensor for
access to the Database. In return you agree to certain conditions of
use on this access as outlined in this License. 

2.3 Rights not
covered. 

     a. This License does not apply to computer programs
used in the making or operation of the Database; 

     b. This
License does not cover any patents over the Contents or the Database;
and

     c. This License does not cover any trademarks associated
with the Database. 

2.4 Relationship to Contents in the Database. The
individual items of the Contents contained in this Database may be
covered by other rights, including copyright, patent, data protection,
privacy, or personality rights, and this License does not cover any
rights (other than Database Rights or in contract) in individual
Contents contained in the Database. For example, if used on a Database
of images (the Contents), this License would not apply to copyright
over individual images, which could have their own separate licenses,
or one single license covering all of the rights over the images.


3.0 Rights granted

3.1 Subject to the terms and conditions of this
License, the Licensor grants to You a worldwide, royalty-free,
non-exclusive, terminable (but only under Section 9) license to Use
the Database for the duration of any applicable copyright and Database
Rights. These rights explicitly include commercial use, and do not
exclude any field of endeavour. To the extent possible in the relevant
jurisdiction, these rights may be exercised in all media and formats
whether now known or created in the future. 

The rights granted
cover, for example:

     a. Extraction and Re-utilisation of the
whole or a Substantial part of the Contents;

     b. Creation of
Derivative Databases;

     c. Creation of Collective Databases;

    
d. Creation of temporary or permanent reproductions by any means and
in any form, in whole or in part, including of any Derivative
Databases or as a part of Collective Databases; and

     e.
Distribution, communication, display, lending, making available, or
performance to the public by any means and in any form, in whole or in
part, including of any Derivative Database or as a part of Collective
Databases.

3.2 Compulsory license schemes. For the avoidance of
doubt:

     a. Non-waivable compulsory license schemes. In those
jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any
statutory or compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the
Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for
any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License;

     b.
Waivable compulsory license schemes. In those jurisdictions in which
the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory
licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the exclusive
right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights
granted under this License; and,

     c. Voluntary license schemes.
The Licensor waives the right to collect royalties, whether
individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a member of a
collecting society that administers voluntary licensing schemes, via
that society, from any exercise by You of the rights granted under
this License.

3.3 The right to release the Database under different
terms, or to stop distributing or making available the Database, is
reserved. Note that this Database may be multiple-licensed, and so You
may have the choice of using alternative licenses for this Database.
Subject to Section 10.4, all other rights not expressly granted by
Licensor are reserved.

4.0 Conditions of Use

4.1 The rights granted
in Section 3 above are expressly made subject to Your complying with
the following conditions of use. These are important conditions of
this License, and if You fail to follow them, You will be in material
breach of its terms.

4.2 Notices. If You Publicly Convey this
Database, any Derivative Database, or the Database as part of a
Collective Database, then You must: 

     a. Do so only under the
terms of this License or another license permitted under Section
4.4;

     b. Include a copy of this License (or, as applicable, a
license permitted under Section 4.4) or its Uniform Resource
Identifier (URI) with the Database or Derivative Database, including
both in the Database or Derivative Database and in any relevant
documentation; and

     c. Keep intact any copyright or Database
Right notices and notices that refer to this License.

     d. If it
is not possible to put the required notices in a particular file due
to its structure, then You must include the notices in a location
(such as a relevant directory) where users would be likely to look for
it.

4.3 Notice for using output (Contents). Creating and Using a
Produced Work does not require the notice in Section 4.2. However, if
you Publicly Use a Produced Work, You must include a notice associated
with the Produced Work reasonably calculated to make any Person that
uses, views, accesses, interacts with, or is otherwise exposed to the
Produced Work aware that Content was obtained from the Database,
Derivative Database, or the Database as part of a Collective Database,
and that it is available under this License.

     a. Example notice.
The following text will satisfy notice under Section 4.3:

         
Contains information from DATABASE NAME, which is made available here
under the Open Database License (ODbL).

DATABASE NAME should be
replaced with the name of the Database and a hyperlink to the URI of
the Database. ""Open Database License"" should contain a hyperlink to
the URI of the text of this License. If hyperlinks are not possible,
You should include the plain text of the required URI's with the above
notice. 4.4 Share alike. 

     a. Any Derivative Database that You
Publicly Use must be only under the terms of: 

          i. This
License;

          ii. A later version of this License similar in
spirit to this License; or

          iii. A compatible license. 

   
 If You license the Derivative Database under one of the licenses
mentioned in (iii), You must comply with the terms of that license. 


    b. For the avoidance of doubt, Extraction or Re-utilisation of the
whole or a Substantial part of the Contents into a new database is a
Derivative Database and must comply with Section 4.4. 

     c.
Derivative Databases and Produced Works. A Derivative Database is
Publicly Used and so must comply with Section 4.4. if a Produced Work
created from the Derivative Database is Publicly Used.

     d. Share
Alike and additional Contents. For the avoidance of doubt, You must
not add Contents to Derivative Databases under Section 4.4 a that are
incompatible with the rights granted under this License. 

     e.
Compatible licenses. Licensors may authorise a proxy to determine
compatible licenses under Section 4.4 a iii. If they do so, the
authorised proxy's public statement of acceptance of a compatible
license grants You permission to use the compatible license. 

4.5
Limits of Share Alike. The requirements of Section 4.4 do not apply in
the following:

     a. For the avoidance of doubt, You are not
required to license Collective Databases under this License if You
incorporate this Database or a Derivative Database in the collection,
but this License still applies to this Database or a Derivative
Database as a part of the Collective Database; 

     b. Using this
Database, a Derivative Database, or this Database as part of a
Collective Database to create a Produced Work does not create a
Derivative Database for purposes of Section 4.4; and

     c. Use of a
Derivative Database internally within an organisation is not to the
public and therefore does not fall under the requirements of Section
4.4.

4.6 Access to Derivative Databases. If You Publicly Use a
Derivative Database or a Produced Work from a Derivative Database, You
must also offer to recipients of the Derivative Database or Produced
Work a copy in a machine readable form of:

     a. The entire
Derivative Database; or

     b. A file containing all of the
alterations made to the Database or the method of making the
alterations to the Database (such as an algorithm), including any
additional Contents, that make up all the differences between the
Database and the Derivative Database.

The Derivative Database (under
a.) or alteration file (under b.) must be available at no more than a
reasonable production cost for physical distributions and free of
charge if distributed over the internet.

4.7 Technological measures
and additional terms

     a. This License does not allow You to
impose (except subject to Section 4.7 b.) any terms or any
technological measures on the Database, a Derivative Database, or the
whole or a Substantial part of the Contents that alter or restrict the
terms of this License, or any rights granted under it, or have the
effect or intent of restricting the ability of any person to exercise
those rights.

     b. Parallel distribution. You may impose terms or
technological measures on the Database, a Derivative Database, or the
whole or a Substantial part of the Contents (a ""Restricted Database"")
in contravention of Section 4.74 a. only if You also make a copy of
the Database or a Derivative Database available to the recipient of
the Restricted Database:

          i. That is available without
additional fee;

          ii. That is available in a medium that does
not alter or restrict the terms of this License, or any rights granted
under it, or have the effect or intent of restricting the ability of
any person to exercise those rights (an ""Unrestricted Database"");
and

          iii. The Unrestricted Database is at least as
accessible to the recipient as a practical matter as the Restricted
Database.

     c. For the avoidance of doubt, You may place this
Database or a Derivative Database in an authenticated environment,
behind a password, or within a similar access control scheme provided
that You do not alter or restrict the terms of this License or any
rights granted under it or have the effect or intent of restricting
the ability of any person to exercise those rights. 

4.8 Licensing of
others. You may not sublicense the Database. Each time You communicate
the Database, the whole or Substantial part of the Contents, or any
Derivative Database to anyone else in any way, the Licensor offers to
the recipient a license to the Database on the same terms and
conditions as this License. You are not responsible for enforcing
compliance by third parties with this License, but You may enforce any
rights that You have over a Derivative Database. You are solely
responsible for any modifications of a Derivative Database made by You
or another Person at Your direction. You may not impose any further
restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under
this License.

5.0 Moral rights

5.1 Moral rights. This section covers
moral rights, including any rights to be identified as the author of
the Database or to object to treatment that would otherwise prejudice
the author's honour and reputation, or any other derogatory
treatment:

     a. For jurisdictions allowing waiver of moral rights,
Licensor waives all moral rights that Licensor may have in the
Database to the fullest extent possible by the law of the relevant
jurisdiction under Section 10.4; 

     b. If waiver of moral rights
under Section 5.1 a in the relevant jurisdiction is not possible,
Licensor agrees not to assert any moral rights over the Database and
waives all claims in moral rights to the fullest extent possible by
the law of the relevant jurisdiction under Section 10.4; and

     c.
For jurisdictions not allowing waiver or an agreement not to assert
moral rights under Section 5.1 a and b, the author may retain their
moral rights over certain aspects of the Database.

Please note that
some jurisdictions do not allow for the waiver of moral rights, and so
moral rights may still subsist over the Database in some
jurisdictions.

6.0 Fair dealing, Database exceptions, and other
rights not affected 

6.1 This License does not affect any rights that
You or anyone else may independently have under any applicable law to
make any use of this Database, including without limitation:

     a.
Exceptions to the Database Right including: Extraction of Contents
from non-electronic Databases for private purposes, Extraction for
purposes of illustration for teaching or scientific research, and
Extraction or Re-utilisation for public security or an administrative
or judicial procedure. 

     b. Fair dealing, fair use, or any other
legally recognised limitation or exception to infringement of
copyright or other applicable laws. 

6.2 This License does not affect
any rights of lawful users to Extract and Re-utilise insubstantial
parts of the Contents, evaluated quantitatively or qualitatively, for
any purposes whatsoever, including creating a Derivative Database
(subject to other rights over the Contents, see Section 2.4). The
repeated and systematic Extraction or Re-utilisation of insubstantial
parts of the Contents may however amount to the Extraction or
Re-utilisation of a Substantial part of the Contents.

7.0 Warranties
and Disclaimer

7.1 The Database is licensed by the Licensor ""as is""
and without any warranty of any kind, either express, implied, or
arising by statute, custom, course of dealing, or trade usage.
Licensor specifically disclaims any and all implied warranties or
conditions of title, non-infringement, accuracy or completeness, the
presence or absence of errors, fitness for a particular purpose,
merchantability, or otherwise. Some jurisdictions do not allow the
exclusion of implied warranties, so this exclusion may not apply to
You.

8.0 Limitation of liability

8.1 Subject to any liability that
may not be excluded or limited by law, the Licensor is not liable for,
and expressly excludes, all liability for loss or damage however and
whenever caused to anyone by any use under this License, whether by
You or by anyone else, and whether caused by any fault on the part of
the Licensor or not. This exclusion of liability includes, but is not
limited to, any special, incidental, consequential, punitive, or
exemplary damages such as loss of revenue, data, anticipated profits,
and lost business. This exclusion applies even if the Licensor has
been advised of the possibility of such damages.

8.2 If liability may
not be excluded by law, it is limited to actual and direct financial
loss to the extent it is caused by proved negligence on the part of
the Licensor.

9.0 Termination of Your rights under this License

9.1
Any breach by You of the terms and conditions of this License
automatically terminates this License with immediate effect and
without notice to You. For the avoidance of doubt, Persons who have
received the Database, the whole or a Substantial part of the
Contents, Derivative Databases, or the Database as part of a
Collective Database from You under this License will not have their
licenses terminated provided their use is in full compliance with this
License or a license granted under Section 4.8 of this License.
Sections 1, 2, 7, 8, 9 and 10 will survive any termination of this
License.

9.2 If You are not in breach of the terms of this License,
the Licensor will not terminate Your rights under it. 

9.3 Unless
terminated under Section 9.1, this License is granted to You for the
duration of applicable rights in the Database. 

9.4 Reinstatement of
rights. If you cease any breach of the terms and conditions of this
License, then your full rights under this License will be
reinstated:

     a. Provisionally and subject to permanent
termination until the 60th day after cessation of breach; 

     b.
Permanently on the 60th day after cessation of breach unless otherwise
reasonably notified by the Licensor; or

     c. Permanently if
reasonably notified by the Licensor of the violation, this is the
first time You have received notice of violation of this License from
the Licensor, and You cure the violation prior to 30 days after your
receipt of the notice.

Persons subject to permanent termination of
rights are not eligible to be a recipient and receive a license under
Section 4.8.

9.5 Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the
right to release the Database under different license terms or to stop
distributing or making available the Database. Releasing the Database
under different license terms or stopping the distribution of the
Database will not withdraw this License (or any other license that has
been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License),
and this License will continue in full force and effect unless
terminated as stated above.

10.0 General

10.1 If any provision of
this License is held to be invalid or unenforceable, that must not
affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms
and conditions of this License and each remaining provision of this
License shall be valid and enforced to the fullest extent permitted by
law. 

10.2 This License is the entire agreement between the parties
with respect to the rights granted here over the Database. It replaces
any earlier understandings, agreements or representations with respect
to the Database. 

10.3 If You are in breach of the terms of this
License, You will not be entitled to rely on the terms of this License
or to complain of any breach by the Licensor. 

10.4 Choice of law.
This License takes effect in and will be governed by the laws of the
relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be
enforced. If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable
copyright law and Database Rights in the relevant jurisdiction
includes additional rights not granted under this License, these
additional rights are granted in this License in order to meet the
terms of this License.

PREAMBLE 

The
goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide
development of cooperative font projects, to support the font creation
efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide an open
framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership
with others.

The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied,
modified and redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by
themselves. The fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled,
embedded, redistributed and sold with any software provided that the
font names of derivative works are changed. The fonts and derivatives,
however, cannot be released under any other type of
license.

""Reserved Font Name""
refers to the Font Software name as seen by users and any other names
as specified after the copyright statement.

""Standard Version"" refers
to the collection of Font Software components as distributed by the
Copyright Holder.

SIL OPEN FONT LICENSE

Version 1.1 - 26 February 2007

PREAMBLE 

The
goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide
development of collaborative font projects, to support the font
creation efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to
provide a free and open framework in which fonts may be shared and
improved in partnership with others.

The OFL allows the licensed
fonts to be used, studied, modified and redistributed freely as long
as they are not sold by themselves. The fonts, including any
derivative works, can be bundled, embedded, redistributed and/or sold
with any software provided that any reserved names are not used by
derivative works. The fonts and derivatives, however, cannot be
released under any other type of license. The requirement for fonts to
remain under this license does not apply to any document created using
the fonts or their derivatives.

DEFINITIONS 

""Font Software"" refers
to the set of files released by the Copyright Holder(s) under this
license and clearly marked as such. This may include source files,
build scripts and documentation.

""Reserved Font Name"" refers to any
names specified as such after the copyright statement(s).

""Original
Version"" refers to the collection of Font Software components as
distributed by the Copyright Holder(s).

""Modified Version"" refers to
any derivative made by adding to, deleting, or substituting — in
part or in whole — any of the components of the Original Version, by
changing formats or by porting the Font Software to a new
environment.

""Author"" refers to any designer, engineer, programmer,
technical writer or other person who contributed to the Font
Software.

PERMISSION & CONDITIONS 

Permission is hereby granted,
free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of the Font Software,
to use, study, copy, merge, embed, modify, redistribute, and sell
modified and unmodified copies of the Font Software, subject to the
following conditions:

1) Neither the Font Software nor any of its
individual components, in Original or Modified Versions, may be sold
by itself.

2) Original or Modified Versions of the Font Software may
be bundled, redistributed and/or sold with any software, provided that
each copy contains the above copyright notice and this license. These
can be included either as stand-alone text files, human-readable
headers or in the appropriate machine-readable metadata fields within
text or binary files as long as those fields can be easily viewed by
the user.

3) No Modified Version of the Font Software may use the
Reserved Font Name(s) unless explicit written permission is granted by
the corresponding Copyright Holder. This restriction only applies to
the primary font name as presented to the users.

4) The name(s) of
the Copyright Holder(s) or the Author(s) of the Font Software shall
not be used to promote, endorse or advertise any Modified Version,
except to acknowledge the contribution(s) of the Copyright Holder(s)
and the Author(s) or with their explicit written permission.

5) The
Font Software, modified or unmodified, in part or in whole, must be
distributed entirely under this license, and must not be distributed
under any other license. The requirement for fonts to remain under
this license does not apply to any document created using the Font
Software.

TERMINATION 

This license becomes null and void if any of
the above conditions are not met.

Preamble

The intent of this
document is to state the conditions under which a Package may be
copied, such that the Copyright Holder maintains some semblance of
artistic control over the development of the package, while giving the
users of the package the right to use and distribute the Package in a
more-or-less customary fashion, plus the right to make reasonable
modifications.

Testing is essential for proper development and
maintenance of standards-based products.

For buyers: adequate
conformance testing leads to reduced integration costs and protection
of investments in applications, software and people.

For software
developers: conformance testing of platforms and middleware greatly
reduces the cost of developing and maintaining multi-platform
application software.

For suppliers: In-depth testing increases
customer satisfaction and keeps development and support costs in
check. API conformance is highly measurable and suppliers who claim it
must be able to substantiate that claim.

As such, since these are
benchmark measures of conformance, we feel the integrity of test tools
is of importance. In order to preserve the integrity of the existing
conformance modes of this test package and to permit recipients of
modified versions of this package to run the original test modes, this
license requires that the original test modes be preserved.

If you
find a bug in one of the standards mode test cases, please let us know
so we can feed this back into the original, and also raise any
specification issues with the appropriate bodies (for example the
POSIX committees).

Definitions: 

     ""Package"" refers to the
collection of files distributed by the Copyright Holder, and
derivatives of that collection of files created through textual
modification. 

     ""Standard Version"" refers to such a Package if it
has not been modified, or has been modified in accordance with the
wishes of the Copyright Holder. 

     ""Copyright Holder"" is whoever
is named in the copyright or copyrights for the package. 

     ""You""
is you, if you're thinking about copying or distributing this Package.


     ""Reasonable copying fee"" is whatever you can justify on the
basis of media cost, duplication charges, time of people involved, and
so on. (You will not be required to justify it to the Copyright
Holder, but only to the computing community at large as a market that
must bear the fee.) 

     ""Freely Available"" means that no fee is
charged for the item itself, though there may be fees involved in
handling the item. It also means that recipients of the item may
redistribute it under the same conditions they received it. 

1. You
may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the
Standard Version of this Package without restriction, provided that
you duplicate all of the original copyright notices and associated
disclaimers.

2. You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other
modifications derived from the Public Domain or from the Copyright
Holder. A Package modified in such a way shall still be considered the
Standard Version.

3. You may otherwise modify your copy of this
Package in any way, provided that you insert a prominent notice in
each changed file stating how and when you changed that file, and
provided that you do at least the following:

     rename any
non-standard executables and testcases so the names do not conflict
with standard executables and testcases, which must also be provided,
and provide a separate manual page for each non-standard executable
and testcase that clearly documents how it differs from the Standard
Version.

4. You may distribute the programs of this Package in object
code or executable form, provided that you do at least the following:


     accompany any non-standard executables and testcases with their
corresponding Standard Version executables and testcases, giving the
non-standard executables and testcases non-standard names, and clearly
documenting the differences in manual pages (or equivalent), together
with instructions on where to get the Standard Version.

5. You may
charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of this Package.
You may charge any fee you choose for support of this Package. You may
not charge a fee for this Package itself. However, you may distribute
this Package in aggregate with other (possibly commercial) programs as
part of a larger (possibly commercial) software distribution provided
that you do not advertise this Package as a product of your own.

6.
The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as
output from the programs of this Package do not automatically fall
under the copyright of this Package, but belong to whomever generated
them, and may be sold commercially, and may be aggregated with this
Package.

7.Subroutines supplied by you and linked into this Package
shall not be considered part of this Package. 

8. The name of the
Copyright Holder may not be used to endorse or promote products
derived from this software without specific prior written
permission.

9. THIS PACKAGE IS PROVIDED ""AS IS"" AND WITHOUT ANY
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.

3.
Distribution Obligations.

     3.1. Application of License. The
Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are governed
by the terms of this License, including without limitation Section
2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be distributed only
under the terms of this License or a future version of this License
released under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of this
License with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not
offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or
restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients'
rights hereunder. However, You may include an additional document
offering the additional rights described in Section 3.5.

     3.2.
Availability of Source Code. Any Modification which You create or to
which You contribute must be made available, prior to any use, except
for internal development and practice, in Source Code form under the
terms of this License either on the same media as an Executable
version or via an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone
to whom you made an Executable version available; and if made
available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must remain available
for at least twelve (12) months after the date it initially became
available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent version of
that particular Modification has been made available to such
recipients. You shall notify the Initial Developer of the Modification
and the location of the Source Code via the contact means provided for
in the Developer Specific license. Initial Developer will be acting as
maintainer of the Source Code and may provide an Electronic
Distribution mechanism for the Modification to be made available.

   
 3.3. Description of Modifications. You must cause all Covered Code to
which you contribute to contain a file documenting the changes You
made to create that Covered Code and the date of any change. You must
include a prominent statement that the Modification is derived,
directly or indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial
Developer and including the name of the Initial Developer in (a) the
Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version or related
documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership of the
Covered Code.

     3.4. Intellectual Property Matters

          (a)
Third Party Claims. If You have knowledge that a party claims an
intellectual property right in particular functionality or code (or
its utilization under this License), you must include a text file with
the source code distribution titled ""LEGAL"" which describes the claim
and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient
will know whom to contact. If you obtain such knowledge after You make
Your Modification available as described in Section 3.2, You shall
promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies You make available
thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate
mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who
received the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.

     
    (b) Representations. Contributor represents that, except as
disclosed pursuant to Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that
Contributor's Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s)
and/or Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed
by this License.

     3.5. Required Notices. You must duplicate the
notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code, and this License
in any documentation for the Source Code, where You describe
recipients' rights relating to Covered Code. If You created one or
more Modification(s), You may add your name as a Contributor to the
notice described in Exhibit A. If it is not possible to put such
notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then you
must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory
file) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice. You may
choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity
or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code.
However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of
the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely
clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability
obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify
the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred
by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty,
support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.

     3.6.
Distribution of Executable Versions. You may distribute Covered Code
in Executable form only if the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have
been met for that Covered Code, and if You include a notice stating
that the Source Code version of the Covered Code is available under
the terms of this License, including a description of how and where
You have fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be
conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable version, related
documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients' rights
relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable
version of Covered Code under a license of Your choice, which may
contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in
compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the
Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's
rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this
License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different
license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ
from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial
Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the
Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by
the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such
terms You offer. If you distribute executable versions containing
Covered Code, you must reproduce the notice in Exhibit B in the
documentation and/or other materials provided with the product.

    
3.7. Larger Works. You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered
Code with other code not governed by the terms of this License and
distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You
must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the
Covered Code.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or
Regulation.

If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the
terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code
due to statute or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms
of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) Cite all of
the statutes or regulations that prohibit you from complying fully
with this license. (c) describe the limitations and the code they
affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described
in Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the
Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation,
such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of
ordinary skill to be able to understand it.

5. Application of this
License.

This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer
has attached the notice in Exhibit A, and to related Covered Code.

6.
Versions of the License.

     6.1. New Versions. License Author may
publish revised and/or new versions of the License from time to time.
Each version will be given a distinguishing version number and shall
be submitted to opensource.org for certification.

     6.2. Effect of
New Versions. Once Covered Code has been published under a particular
version of the License, You may always continue to use it under the
terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code
under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by
Initial Developer. No one other than Initial Developer has the right
to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under this
License.

     6.3. Derivative Works. If you create or use a modified
version of this License, except in association with the required
Developer Specific License described in section 6.4, (which you may
only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code
governed by this License), you must (a) rename Your license so that
the phrases ``Open'', ``OpenPL'', ``OPL'' or any confusingly similar
phrase do not appear anywhere in your license and (b) otherwise make
it clear that your version of the license contains terms which differ
from the Open Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial
Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in
Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of
this License.)

     6.4. Required Additional Developer Specific
License
This license is a union of the following two parts that should
be found as text files in the same place (directory), in the order of
preeminence:

          [1] A Developer specific license.

         
[2] The contents of this file OPL_1_0.TXT, stating the general
licensing policy of the software.

In case of conflicting dispositions
in the parts of this license, the terms of the lower-numbered part
will always be superseded by the terms of the higher numbered
part.

7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.

COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS
LICENSE ON AN ""AS IS"" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER
EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT
THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE
QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY
COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL
DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY
SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY
CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED
CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

8.
TERMINATION.

     8.1 Termination upon Breach
This License and the
rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to
comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days
of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Code,
which are properly granted, shall survive any termination of this
License. Provisions that, by their nature, must remain in effect
beyond the termination of this License shall survive.

     8.2.
Termination Upon Litigation. If You initiate litigation by asserting a
patent infringement claim (excluding declatory judgment actions)
against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or
Contributor against whom You file such action is referred to as
""Participant"") alleging that:

          (a) such Participant's
Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then
any and all rights granted by such Participant to You under Sections
2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from
Participant terminate prospectively, unless if within 60 days after
receipt of notice You either: (i) agree in writing to pay Participant
a mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and future use
of Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your
litigation claim with respect to the Contributor Version against such
Participant. If within 60 days of notice, a reasonable royalty and
payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the
parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted
by Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically
terminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice period specified
above.

          (b) any software, hardware, or device, other than
such Participant's Contributor Version, directly or indirectly
infringes any patent, then any rights granted to You by such
Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as
of the date You first made, used, sold, distributed, or had made,
Modifications made by that Participant.

     8.3. If You assert a
patent infringement claim against Participant alleging that such
Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any
patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement)
prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the
reasonable value of the licenses granted by such Participant under
Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the
amount or value of any payment or license.

     8.4. In the event of
termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all end user license
agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been
validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to
termination shall survive termination.

9. LIMITATION OF
LIABILITY.

UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER
TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL THE INITIAL
DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE,
OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY OTHER
PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES
OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF
GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND
ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE
BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF
LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY
RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW
PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE
EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO
THAT EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

10. U.S.
GOVERNMENT END USERS.

The Covered Code is a ``commercial item,'' as
that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of
``commercial computer software'' and ``commercial computer software
documentation,'' as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept.
1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1
through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire

Responsibilities

     3.1 Distribution of Source Form 
     All
distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be
under the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the
Source Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of
this License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You must
cause any of Your Modifications to carry prominent notices stating
that You changed the files. You may not attempt to alter or restrict
the recipients’ rights in the Source Code Form.

     3.2
Distribution of Executable Form 
     If You distribute Covered
Software in Executable Form then: 


          a. such Covered
Software must also be made available in Source Code Form, as described
in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the Executable Form
how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by reasonable
means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost of
distribution to the recipient; and 
          b. You may distribute
such Executable Form under the terms of this License, or sublicense it
under different terms, provided that the license for the Executable
Form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients’ rights in
the Source Code Form under this License.

     3.3 Distribution of a
Larger Work 
     You may create and distribute a Larger Work under
terms of Your choice, provided that You also comply with the
requirements of this License for the Covered Software. If the Larger
Work is a combination of Covered Software with a work governed by one
or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered Software is not
Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License permits You to
additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of such
Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at
their option, further distribute the Covered Software under the terms
of either this License or such Secondary License(s).

     3.4
Notices 
     You may not remove or alter the substance of any
license notices (including copyright notices, patent notices,
disclaimers of warranty, or limitations of liability) contained within
the Source Code Form of the Covered Software, except that You may
alter any license notices to the extent required to remedy known
factual inaccuracies.

     3.5 Application of Additional Terms

     
    3.5.1 You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty,
support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients
of Covered Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf,
and not on behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely
clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability
obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify
every Contributor for any liability incurred by such Contributor as a
result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.
You may include additional disclaimers of warranty and limitations of
liability specific to any jurisdiction.

          3.5.2 You may place
additional conditions upon the rights granted in this License to the
extent necessary due to statute, judicial order, regulation (including
without limitation state and federal procurement regulation), national
security, or public interest. Any such additional conditions must be
clearly described in the notice provisions required under Section 3.4.
 Any alteration of the terms of this License will apply to all copies
of the Covered Software distributed by You or by any downstream
recipients that receive the Covered Software from You.

4. Inability
to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
If it is impossible for You to
comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or
all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial order, or
regulation, then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License
to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and
the code they affect. Such description must be included in the notices
required under Section 3.4. Except to the extent prohibited by statute
or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a
recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.

5.
Termination

     5.1 Failure to Comply 
     The rights granted
under this License will terminate automatically if You fail to comply
with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant, then the
rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor are
reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor
explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing
basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance
by some reasonable means prior to 60-days after You have come back
into compliance.  Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor
are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of
the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the first time
You have received notice of non-compliance with this License from such
Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30-days after Your
receipt of the notice.

     5.2 Patent Infringement Claims 
     If
You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version
directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted
to You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under
Section 2.1 of this License shall terminate.

     5.3 Additional
Compliance Terms 
     Notwithstanding the foregoing in this Section
5, for purposes of this Section, if You breach Section 3.1
(Distribution of Source Form), Section 3.2 (Distribution of Executable
Form), Section 3.3 (Distribution of a Larger Work), or Section 3.4
(Notices), then becoming compliant as described in Section 5.1 must
also include, no later than 30 days after receipt by You of notice of
such violation by a Contributor, making the Covered Software available
in Source Code Form as required by this License on a publicly
available computer network for a period of no less than three (3)
years.

     5.4 Contributor Remedies 
     If You fail to comply
with the terms of this License and do not thereafter
become 
compliant in accordance with Section 5.1 and, if applicable,
Section 5.3, then each Contributor reserves its right, in addition to
any other rights it may have in law or in equity, to bring an action
seeking injunctive relief, or damages for willful copyright or patent
infringement (including without limitation damages for unjust
enrichment, where available under law), for all actions in violation
of rights that would otherwise have been granted under the terms of
this License.

     5.5 End User License Agreements 
     In the
event of termination under this Section 5, all end user license
agreements 
(excluding distributors and resellers), which have been
validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior
to termination shall survive termination.

6. Disclaimer of
Warranty
Covered Software is provided under this License on an “as
is” basis, without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied,
or statutory, including, without limitation, warranties that the
Covered Software is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a
particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as to the
quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You.  Should
any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You (not any
Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or
correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an 
essential
part of this License.  No use of any Covered Software is authorized
under this License except under this disclaimer.

7. Limitation of
Liability
Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether
tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any
Contributor, or anyone who distributes Covered Software as permitted
above, be liable to You for any direct, indirect, special, incidental,
or consequential damages of any character including, without
limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of goodwill, work stoppage,
computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial
damages or losses, even if such party shall have been informed of the
possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability shall not
apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such
party’s negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such
limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or
limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion
and limitation may not apply to You.

8. Litigation
Any litigation
relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of a
jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of
business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that
jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions.
Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party’s ability to bring
cross-claims or counter-claims.

9. Government Terms

     9.1
Commercial Item 
     The Covered Software is a “commercial
item,” as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995),
consisting of “commercial computer software” and “commercial
computer software documentation,” as such terms are used in 48
C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48
C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government
End Users acquire Covered Software with only those rights set forth
herein.
     
     9.2 No Sovereign Immunity 
     The U.S. federal
government and states that use or distribute Covered Software hereby
waive their sovereign immunity with respect to enforcement of the
provisions of this License.

     9.3 Choice of Law and Venue

       
  9.3.1 If You are a government of a state of the United States, or
Your use of the Covered Software is pursuant to a procurement contract
with such a state government, this License shall be governed by the
law of such state, excluding its conflict-of-law provisions, and the
adjudication of disputes relating to this License will be subject to
the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in
such state.
          9.3.2 If You are an agency of the United States
federal government, or Your use of the Covered Software is pursuant to
a procurement contract with such an agency, this License shall be
governed by federal law for all purposes, and the adjudication of
disputes relating to this License will be subject to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the federal courts located in Washington, 
D.C.
     
    9.3.3 You may alter the terms of this Section 9.3 for this License
as described in Section 3.5.2.

     9.4 Supremacy 
     This Section
9 is in lieu of, and supersedes, any other Federal Acquisition
Regulation, Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation, or other clause or
provision that addresses government rights in computer software under
this License.

10. Miscellaneous 

This License represents the
complete agreement concerning the subject matter hereof. If any
provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision
shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable.
Any law or regulation, which provides that the language of a contract
shall be construed against the drafter, shall not be used to construe
this License against a Contributor.

11. Versions of the License

    
11.1 New Versions 
The Open Source Election Technology Foundation
(“OSET”) (formerly known as the Open Source Digital Voting
Foundation) is the steward of this License. Except as provided in
Section 11.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to
modify or publish new versions of this License.  Each version will be
given a distinguishing version number.

     11.2 Effects of New
Versions 
You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of
the version of the License under which You originally received the
Covered Software, or under the terms of any subsequent version
published by the license steward.

     11.3 Modified Versions 
If
You create software not governed by this License, and You want to
create a new license for such software, You may create and use a
modified version of this License if You rename the license and remove
any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that
such modified license differs from this License).

     11.4

non-exclusive, perpetual, non-sublicenseable license under the
Licensed Claims to make, use, sell and offer for sale Derivative
Works.

3) Grant of Source Code License. The term ""Source Code"" means
the preferred form of the Original Work for making modifications to it
and all available documentation describing how to access and modify
the Original Work. Licensor hereby agrees to provide a
machine-readable copy of the Source Code of the Original Work along
with each copy of the Original Work that Licensor distributes.
Licensor reserves the right to satisfy this obligation by placing a
machine-readable copy of the Source Code in an information repository
reasonably calculated to permit inexpensive and convenient access by
You for as long as Licensor continues to distribute the Original Work,
and by publishing the address of that information repository in a
notice immediately following the copyright notice that applies to the
Original Work.

4) Exclusions From License Grant. Nothing in this
License shall be deemed to grant any rights to trademarks, copyrights,
patents, trade secrets or any other intellectual property of Licensor
except as expressly stated herein. No patent license is granted to
make, use, sell or offer to sell embodiments of any patent claims
other than the Licensed Claims defined in Section 2. No right is
granted to the trademarks of Licensor even if such marks are included
in the Original Work. Nothing in this License shall be interpreted to
prohibit Licensor from licensing under different terms from this
License any Original Work that Licensor otherwise would have a right
to license.

5) External Deployment. The term ""External Deployment""
means the use or distribution of the Original Work or Derivative Works
in any way such that the Original Work or Derivative Works may be
accessed or used by anyone other than You, whether the Original Work

as an application intended for use over a computer network, or used to
provide services or otherwise deliver content to anyone other than
You. As an express condition for the grants of license hereunder, You
agree that any External Deployment by You shall be deemed a
distribution and shall be licensed to all under the terms of this
License, as prescribed in section 1(c) herein.

6) Warranty and
Disclaimer of Warranty. LICENSOR WARRANTS THAT THE COPYRIGHT IN AND TO
THE ORIGINAL WORK IS OWNED BY THE LICENSOR OR THAT THE ORIGINAL WORK
IS DISTRIBUTED BY LICENSOR UNDER A VALID CURRENT LICENSE FROM THE
COPYRIGHT OWNER. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY STATED IN THE IMMEDIATELY
PRECEEDING SENTENCE, THE ORIGINAL WORK IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE
ON AN ""AS IS"" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,
INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE WARRANTY OF NON-INFRINGEMENT AND
WARRANTIES THAT THE ORIGINAL WORK IS MERCHANTABLE OR FIT FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY OF THE ORIGINAL

PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO LICENSE TO ORIGINAL WORK IS GRANTED HEREUNDER

IF SUCH PERSON SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR
DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE
EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO
NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

8)
Acceptance and Termination. Nothing else but this License (or another
written agreement between Licensor and You) grants You permission to
create Derivative Works based upon the Original Work, and any attempt
to do so except under the terms of this License (or another written
agreement between Licensor and You) is expressly prohibited by U.S.
copyright law, the equivalent laws of other countries, and by
international treaty. Therefore, by exercising any of the rights
granted to You in Sections 1 and 2 herein, You indicate Your
acceptance of this License and all of its terms and conditions. This
license shall terminate immediately and you may no longer exercise any
of the rights granted to You by this License upon Your failure to
honor the proviso in Section 1(c) herein.

9) Mutual Termination for
Patent Action. This License shall terminate automatically and You may
no longer exercise any of the rights granted to You by this License if
You file a lawsuit in any court alleging that any OSI Certified open
source software that is licensed under any license containing this
""Mutual Termination for Patent Action"" clause infringes any patent
claims that are essential to use that software.

10) Jurisdiction,
Venue and Governing Law. You agree that any lawsuit arising under or

3) Grant of Source Code License. The term ""Source Code"" means
the preferred form of the Original Work for making modifications to it
and all available documentation describing how to modify the Original
Work. Licensor hereby agrees to provide a machine-readable copy of the
Source Code of the Original Work along with each copy of the Original
Work that Licensor distributes. Licensor reserves the right to satisfy
this obligation by placing a machine-readable copy of the Source Code
in an information repository reasonably calculated to permit
inexpensive and convenient access by You for as long as Licensor
continues to distribute the Original Work, and by publishing the
address of that information repository in a notice immediately
following the copyright notice that applies to the Original Work. 

4)
Exclusions From License Grant. Nothing in this License shall be deemed
to grant any rights to trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets
or any other intellectual property of Licensor except as expressly
stated herein. No patent license is granted to make, use, sell or
offer to sell embodiments of any patent claims other than the Licensed
Claims defined in Section 2. No right is granted to the trademarks of
Licensor even if such marks are included in the Original Work. Nothing
in this License shall be interpreted to prohibit Licensor from
licensing under different terms from this License any Original Work
that Licensor otherwise would have a right to license.

5) External
Deployment. The term ""External Deployment"" means the use or
distribution of the Original Work or Derivative Works in any way such
that the Original Work or Derivative Works may be used by anyone other

6) Attribution Rights. You must
retain, in the Source Code of any Derivative Works that You create,
all copyright, patent or trademark notices from the Source Code of the

Disclaimer of Warranty. Licensor warrants that the copyright in and to
the Original Work is owned by the Licensor or that the Original Work

all other commercial damages or losses. This limitation of liability
shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting

9) Acceptance and Termination.
If You distribute copies of the Original Work or a Derivative Work,
You must make a reasonable effort under the circumstances to obtain
the express and volitional assent of recipients to the terms of this

of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International
Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any use of the Original Work
outside the scope of this License or after its termination shall be
subject to the requirements and penalties of the U.S. Copyright Act,

6) Attribution Rights. You must
retain, in the Source Code of any Derivative Works that You create,
all copyright, patent or trademark notices from the Source Code of the
Original Work, as well as any notices of licensing and any descriptive
text identified therein as an ""Attribution Notice."" You must cause the
Source Code for any Derivative Works that You create to carry a
prominent Attribution Notice reasonably calculated to inform
recipients that You have modified the Original Work.

7) Warranty of
Provenance and Disclaimer of Warranty. Licensor warrants that the
copyright in and to the Original Work and the patent rights granted
herein by Licensor are owned by the Licensor or are sublicensed to You
under the terms of this License with the permission of the
contributor(s) of those copyrights and patent rights. Except as
expressly stated in the immediately proceeding sentence, the Original
Work is provided under this License on an ""AS IS"" BASIS and WITHOUT
WARRANTY, either express or implied, including, without limitation,
the warranties of NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY OF THE ORIGINAL
WORK IS WITH YOU. This DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY constitutes an essential
part of this License. No license to Original Work is granted hereunder
except under this disclaimer.

8) Limitation of Liability. Under no
circumstances and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including
negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall the Licensor be liable to
any person for any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or
consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this
License or the use of the Original Work including, without limitation,
damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or
malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses. This
limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or
personal injury resulting from Licensor's negligence to the extent
applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some jurisdictions do not
allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential
damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.

9)
Acceptance and Termination. If You distribute copies of the Original
Work or a Derivative Work, You must make a reasonable effort under the
circumstances to obtain the express assent of recipients to the terms
of this License. Nothing else but this License (or another written
agreement between Licensor and You) grants You permission to create
Derivative Works based upon the Original Work or to exercise any of
the rights granted in Section 1 herein, and any attempt to do so
except under the terms of this License (or another written agreement
between Licensor and You) is expressly prohibited by U.S. copyright
law, the equivalent laws of other countries, and by international
treaty. Therefore, by exercising any of the rights granted to You in
Section 1 herein, You indicate Your acceptance of this License and all
of its terms and conditions. This License shall terminate immediately
and you may no longer exercise any of the rights granted to You by
this License upon Your failure to honor the proviso in Section 1(c)
herein.

10) Termination for Patent Action. This License shall
terminate automatically and You may no longer exercise any of the
rights granted to You by this License as of the date You commence an
action, including a cross-claim or counterclaim, for patent
infringement (i) against Licensor with respect to a patent applicable
to software or (ii) against any entity with respect to a patent
applicable to the Original Work (but excluding combinations of the
Original Work with other software or hardware).

11) Jurisdiction,
Venue and Governing Law. Any action or suit relating to this License
may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction wherein the
Licensor resides or in which Licensor conducts its primary business,
and under the laws of that jurisdiction excluding its conflict-of-law
provisions. The application of the United Nations Convention on
Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.
Any use of the Original Work outside the scope of this License or
after its termination shall be subject to the requirements and
penalties of the U.S. Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. 101 et seq., the
equivalent laws of other countries, and international treaty. This
section shall survive the termination of this License.

12) Attorneys
Fees. In any action to enforce the terms of this License or seeking
damages relating thereto, the prevailing party shall be entitled to
recover its costs and expenses, including, without limitation,
reasonable attorneys' fees and costs incurred in connection with such
action, including any appeal of such action. This section shall
survive the termination of this License.

13) Miscellaneous. This
License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject
matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
necessary to make it enforceable.

14) Definition of ""You"" in This
License. ""You"" throughout this License, whether in upper or lower
case, means an individual or a legal entity exercising rights under,
and complying with all of the terms of, this License. For legal
entities, ""You"" includes any entity that controls, is controlled by,
or is under common control with you. For purposes of this definition,
""control"" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

15)
Right to Use. You may use the Original Work in all ways not otherwise
restricted or conditioned by this License or by law, and Licensor
promises not to interfere with or be responsible for such uses by
You.

This Open Software License (the
""License"") applies to any original work of authorship (the ""Original
Work"") whose owner (the ""Licensor"") has placed the following notice
immediately following the copyright notice for the Original Work:

   
 Licensed under the Open Software License version 2.1

1) Grant of
Copyright License. Licensor hereby grants You a world-wide,
royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual, sublicenseable license to do
the following:

     a) to reproduce the Original Work in copies;

   
 b) to prepare derivative works (""Derivative Works"") based upon the
Original Work;

     c) to distribute copies of the Original Work and
Derivative Works to the public, with the proviso that copies of
Original Work or Derivative Works that You distribute shall be
licensed under the Open Software License;

     d) to perform the
Original Work publicly; and

     e) to display the Original Work
publicly.

2) Grant of Patent License. Licensor hereby grants You a
world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual, sublicenseable
license, under patent claims owned or controlled by the Licensor that
are embodied in the Original Work as furnished by the Licensor, to
make, use, sell and offer for sale the Original Work and Derivative
Works.

3) Grant of Source Code License. The term ""Source Code"" means
the preferred form of the Original Work for making modifications to it
and all available documentation describing how to modify the Original
Work. Licensor hereby agrees to provide a machine-readable copy of the
Source Code of the Original Work along with each copy of the Original
Work that Licensor distributes. Licensor reserves the right to satisfy
this obligation by placing a machine-readable copy of the Source Code
in an information repository reasonably calculated to permit
inexpensive and convenient access by You for as long as Licensor
continues to distribute the Original Work, and by publishing the
address of that information repository in a notice immediately
following the copyright notice that applies to the Original Work.

4)
Exclusions From License Grant. Neither the names of Licensor, nor the
names of any contributors to the Original Work, nor any of their
trademarks or service marks, may be used to endorse or promote
products derived from this Original Work without express prior written
permission of the Licensor. Nothing in this License shall be deemed to
grant any rights to trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets or
any other intellectual property of Licensor except as expressly stated
herein. No patent license is granted to make, use, sell or offer to
sell embodiments of any patent claims other than the licensed claims
defined in Section 2. No right is granted to the trademarks of
Licensor even if such marks are included in the Original Work. Nothing
in this License shall be interpreted to prohibit Licensor from
licensing under different terms from this License any Original Work
that Licensor otherwise would have a right to license.

5) External
Deployment. The term ""External Deployment"" means the use or
distribution of the Original Work or Derivative Works in any way such
that the Original Work or Derivative Works may be used by anyone other
than You, whether the Original Work or Derivative Works are
distributed to those persons or made available as an application
intended for use over a computer network. As an express condition for
the grants of license hereunder, You agree that any External
Deployment by You of a Derivative Work shall be deemed a distribution
and shall be licensed to all under the terms of this License, as
prescribed in section 1(c) herein.

6) Attribution Rights. You must
retain, in the Source Code of any Derivative Works that You create,
all copyright, patent or trademark notices from the Source Code of the
Original Work, as well as any notices of licensing and any descriptive
text identified therein as an ""Attribution Notice."" You must cause the
Source Code for any Derivative Works that You create to carry a
prominent Attribution Notice reasonably calculated to inform
recipients that You have modified the Original Work.

7) Warranty of
Provenance and Disclaimer of Warranty. Licensor warrants that the
copyright in and to the Original Work and the patent rights granted
herein by Licensor are owned by the Licensor or are sublicensed to You
under the terms of this License with the permission of the
contributor(s) of those copyrights and patent rights. Except as
expressly stated in the immediately proceeding sentence, the Original
Work is provided under this License on an ""AS IS"" BASIS and WITHOUT
WARRANTY, either express or implied, including, without limitation,
the warranties of NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY OF THE ORIGINAL
WORK IS WITH YOU. This DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY constitutes an essential
part of this License. No license to Original Work is granted hereunder
except under this disclaimer.

8) Limitation of Liability. Under no
circumstances and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including
negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall the Licensor be liable to
any person for any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or
consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this
License or the use of the Original Work including, without limitation,
damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or
malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses. This
limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or
personal injury resulting from Licensor's negligence to the extent
applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some jurisdictions do not
allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential
damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.

9)
Acceptance and Termination. If You distribute copies of the Original
Work or a Derivative Work, You must make a reasonable effort under the
circumstances to obtain the express assent of recipients to the terms
of this License. Nothing else but this License (or another written
agreement between Licensor and You) grants You permission to create
Derivative Works based upon the Original Work or to exercise any of
the rights granted in Section 1 herein, and any attempt to do so
except under the terms of this License (or another written agreement
between Licensor and You) is expressly prohibited by U.S. copyright
law, the equivalent laws of other countries, and by international
treaty. Therefore, by exercising any of the rights granted to You in
Section 1 herein, You indicate Your acceptance of this License and all
of its terms and conditions. This License shall terminate immediately
and you may no longer exercise any of the rights granted to You by
this License upon Your failure to honor the proviso in Section 1(c)
herein.

10) Termination for Patent Action. This License shall
terminate automatically and You may no longer exercise any of the
rights granted to You by this License as of the date You commence an
action, including a cross-claim or counterclaim, against Licensor or
any licensee alleging that the Original Work infringes a patent. This
termination provision shall not apply for an action alleging patent
infringement by combinations of the Original Work with other software
or hardware.

11) Jurisdiction, Venue and Governing Law. Any action or
suit relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of a
jurisdiction wherein the Licensor resides or in which Licensor
conducts its primary business, and under the laws of that jurisdiction
excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. The application of the
United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of
Goods is expressly excluded. Any use of the Original Work outside the
scope of this License or after its termination shall be subject to the
requirements and penalties of the U.S. Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. ¤ 101
et seq., the equivalent laws of other countries, and international
treaty. This section shall survive the termination of this
License.

12) Attorneys Fees. In any action to enforce the terms of
this License or seeking damages relating thereto, the prevailing party
shall be entitled to recover its costs and expenses, including,
without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and costs incurred in
connection with such action, including any appeal of such action. This
section shall survive the termination of this License.

13)
Miscellaneous. This License represents the complete agreement
concerning the subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License
is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to
the extent necessary to make it enforceable.

14) Definition of ""You""
in This License. ""You"" throughout this License, whether in upper or
lower case, means an individual or a legal entity exercising rights
under, and complying with all of the terms of, this License. For legal
entities, ""You"" includes any entity that controls, is controlled by,
or is under common control with you. For purposes of this definition,
""control"" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

15)
Right to Use. You may use the Original Work in all ways not otherwise
restricted or conditioned by this License or by law, and Licensor
promises not to interfere with or be responsible for such uses by
You.

This Open Software License
(the ""License"") applies to any original work of authorship (the

licensing notice adjacent to the copyright notice for the Original
Work:

     Licensed under the Open Software License version 3.0

1)
Grant of Copyright License. Licensor grants You a worldwide,
royalty-free, non-exclusive, sublicensable license, for the duration
of the copyright, to do the following:

     a) to reproduce the
Original Work in copies, either alone or as part of a collective

     b) to translate, adapt, alter, transform, modify, or
arrange the Original Work, thereby creating derivative works
(""Derivative Works"") based upon the Original Work;

Work publicly; and

     e) to display the Original Work publicly.

2)

patents, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, and import the
Original Work and Derivative Works.

3) Grant of Source Code License.
The term ""Source Code"" means the preferred form of the Original Work
for making modifications to it and all available documentation
describing how to modify the Original Work. Licensor agrees to provide
a machine-readable copy of the Source Code of the Original Work along
with each copy of the Original Work that Licensor distributes.
Licensor reserves the right to satisfy this obligation by placing a
machine-readable copy of the Source Code in an information repository
reasonably calculated to permit inexpensive and convenient access by
You for as long as Licensor continues to distribute the Original
Work.

4) Exclusions From License Grant. Neither the names of
Licensor, nor the names of any contributors to the Original Work, nor
any of their trademarks or service marks, may be used to endorse or
promote products derived from this Original Work without express prior
permission of the Licensor. Except as expressly stated herein, nothing
in this License grants any license to Licensor’s trademarks,
copyrights, patents, trade secrets or any other intellectual property.
No patent license is granted to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have
made, or import embodiments of any patent claims other than the
licensed claims defined in Section 2. No license is granted to the
trademarks of Licensor even if such marks are included in the Original
Work. Nothing in this License shall be interpreted to prohibit
Licensor from licensing under terms different from this License any
Original Work that Licensor otherwise would have a right to
license.

5) External Deployment. The term ""External Deployment"" means
the use, distribution, or communication of the Original Work or
Derivative Works in any way such that the Original Work or Derivative
Works may be used by anyone other than You, whether those works are
distributed or communicated to those persons or made available as an
application intended for use over a network. As an express condition
for the grants of license hereunder, You must treat any External
Deployment by You of the Original Work or a Derivative Work as a
distribution under section 1(c).

descriptive text identified therein as an ""Attribution Notice."" You
must cause the Source Code for any Derivative Works that You create to
carry a prominent Attribution Notice reasonably calculated to inform
recipients that You have modified the Original Work.

7) Warranty of
Provenance and Disclaimer of Warranty. Licensor warrants that the
copyright in and to the Original Work and the patent rights granted
herein by Licensor are owned by the Licensor or are sublicensed to You
under the terms of this License with the permission of the
contributor(s) of those copyrights and patent rights. Except as
expressly stated in the immediately preceding sentence, the Original
Work is provided under this License on an ""AS IS"" BASIS and WITHOUT
WARRANTY, either express or implied, including, without limitation,
the warranties of non-infringement, merchantability or fitness for a
particular purpose. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY OF THE ORIGINAL

this License except under this disclaimer.

8) Limitation of
Liability. Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether
in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall the
Licensor be liable to anyone for any indirect, special, incidental, or
consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this
License or the use of the Original Work including, without limitation,

time, You expressly assented to this License, that assent indicates
your clear and irrevocable acceptance of this License and all of its
terms and conditions. If You distribute or communicate copies of the
Original Work or a Derivative Work, You must make a reasonable effort
under the circumstances to obtain the express assent of recipients to
the terms of this License. This License conditions your rights to
undertake the activities listed in Section 1, including your right to
create Derivative Works based upon the Original Work, and doing so
without honoring these terms and conditions is prohibited by copyright
law and international treaty. Nothing in this License is intended to
affect copyright exceptions and limitations (including “fair use”
or “fair dealing”). This License shall terminate immediately and
You may no longer exercise any of the rights granted to You by this
License upon your failure to honor the conditions in Section
1(c).

10) Termination for Patent Action. This License shall terminate

including a cross-claim or counterclaim, against Licensor or any
licensee alleging that the Original Work infringes a patent. This
termination provision shall not apply for an action alleging patent
infringement by combinations of the Original Work with other software
or hardware.

requirements and penalties of copyright or patent law in the
appropriate jurisdiction. This section shall survive the termination
of this License.

12) Attorneys' Fees. In any action to enforce the

and copy, distribute or communicate your modified version (the
""Modified License"") and apply it to other original works of authorship
subject to the following conditions: (i) You may not indicate in any
way that your Modified License is the ""Open Software License"" or ""OSL""
and you may not use those names in the name of your Modified License;
(ii) You must replace the notice specified in the first paragraph
above with the notice ""Licensed under <insert your license name here>""
or with a notice of your own that is not confusingly similar to the

Preamble 
The Open Data Commons - Public Domain Dedication &
Licence is a document intended to allow you to freely share, modify,
and use this work for any purpose and without any restrictions. This
licence is intended for use on databases or their contents (""data""),
either together or individually.

Many databases are covered by
copyright. Some jurisdictions, mainly in Europe, have specific special
rights that cover databases called the ""sui generis"" database right.
Both of these sets of rights, as well as other legal rights used to
protect databases and data, can create uncertainty or practical
difficulty for those wishing to share databases and their underlying
data but retain a limited amount of rights under a ""some rights
reserved"" approach to licensing as outlined in the Science Commons
Protocol for Implementing Open Access Data. As a result, this waiver
and licence tries to the fullest extent possible to eliminate or fully
license any rights that cover this database and data. Any Community
Norms or similar statements of use of the database or data do not form
a part of this document, and do not act as a contract for access or
other terms of use for the database or data.

The position of the
recipient of the work

Because this document places the database and
its contents in or as close as possible within the public domain,
there are no restrictions or requirements placed on the recipient by
this document. Recipients may use this work commercially, use
technical protection measures, combine this data or database with
other databases or data, and share their changes and additions or keep
them secret. It is not a requirement that recipients provide further
users with a copy of this licence or attribute the original creator of
the data or database as a source. The goal is to eliminate
restrictions held by the original creator of the data and database on
the use of it by others.

The position of the dedicator of the
work

Copyright law, as with most other law under the banner of
""intellectual property"", is inherently national law. This means that
there exists several differences in how copyright and other IP rights
can be relinquished, waived or licensed in the many legal
jurisdictions of the world. This is despite much harmonisation of
minimum levels of protection. The internet and other communication
technologies span these many disparate legal jurisdictions and thus
pose special difficulties for a document relinquishing and waiving
intellectual property rights, including copyright and database rights,
for use by the global community. Because of this feature of
intellectual property law, this document first relinquishes the rights
and waives the relevant rights and claims. It then goes on to license
these same rights for jurisdictions or areas of law that may make it
difficult to relinquish or waive rights or claims.

The purpose of
this document is to enable rightsholders to place their work into the
public domain. Unlike licences for free and open source software, free
cultural works, or open content licences, rightsholders will not be
able to ""dual license"" their work by releasing the same work under
different licences. This is because they have allowed anyone to use
the work in whatever way they choose. Rightsholders therefore can’t
re-license it under copyright or database rights on different terms
because they have nothing left to license. Doing so creates truly
accessible data to build rich applications and advance the progress of
science and the arts.

This document can cover either or both of the
database and its contents (the data). Because databases can have a
wide variety of content - not just factual data - rightsholders should
use the Open Data Commons - Public Domain Dedication & Licence for an
entire database and its contents only if everything can be placed
under the terms of this document. Because even factual data can
sometimes have intellectual property rights, rightsholders should use
this licence to cover both the database and its factual data when
making material available under this document; even if it is likely
that the data would not be covered by copyright or database
rights.

Rightsholders can also use this document to cover any
copyright or database rights claims over only a database, and leave
the contents to be covered by other licences or documents. They can do
this because this document refers to the ""Work"", which can be either -
or both - the database and its contents. As a result, rightsholders
need to clearly state what they are dedicating under this document
when they dedicate it.

Just like any licence or other document
dealing with intellectual property, rightsholders should be aware that
one can only license what one owns. Please ensure that the rights have
been cleared to make this material available under this
document.

This document permanently and irrevocably makes the Work
available to the public for any use of any kind, and it should not be
used unless the rightsholder is prepared for this to happen.

Part I:
Introduction

The Rightsholder (the Person holding rights or claims
over the Work) agrees as follows:

2.0 What this
document covers

2.1. Legal effect of this Document. This Document
is:

     a. A dedication to the public domain and waiver of Copyright
and Database Rights over the Work; and

     b. A licence of Copyright
and Database Rights over the Work in jurisdictions that do not allow
for relinquishment or waiver.

2.2. Legal rights covered.

     a.
Copyright. Any copyright or neighbouring rights in the Work. Copyright
law varies between jurisdictions, but is likely to cover: the Database
model or schema, which is the structure, arrangement, and organisation
of the Database, and can also include the Database tables and table
indexes; the data entry and output sheets; and the Field names of Data
stored in the Database. Copyright may also cover the Data depending on
the jurisdiction and type of Data; and

     b. Database Rights.
Database Rights only extend to the extraction and re-utilisation of
the whole or a substantial part of the Data. Database Rights can apply
even when there is no copyright over the Database. Database Rights can
also apply when the Data is removed from the Database and is selected
and arranged in a way that would not infringe any applicable
copyright.

2.2 Rights not covered.

     a. This Document does not
apply to computer programs used in the making or operation of the
Database;

     b. This Document does not cover any patents over the
Data or the Database. Please see Section 4.2 later in this Document
for further details; and

     c. This Document does not cover any
trade marks associated with the Database. Please see Section 4.3 later
in this Document for further details.

Users of this Database are
cautioned that they may have to clear other rights or consult other
licences.

2.3 Facts are free. The Rightsholder takes the position
that factual information is not covered by Copyright. This Document
however covers the Work in jurisdictions that may protect the factual
information in the Work by Copyright, and to cover any information
protected by Copyright that is contained in the Work.

Part II:
Dedication to the public domain

3.0 Dedication, waiver, and licence
of Copyright and Database Rights

3.1 Dedication of Copyright and
Database Rights to the public domain. The Rightsholder by using this
Document, dedicates the Work to the public domain for the benefit of
the public and relinquishes all rights in Copyright and Database
Rights over the Work.

     a. The Rightsholder realises that once
these rights are relinquished, that the Rightsholder has no further
rights in Copyright and Database Rights over the Work, and that the
Work is free and open for others to Use.

     b. The Rightsholder
intends for their relinquishment to cover all present and future
rights in the Work under Copyright and Database Rights, whether they
are vested or contingent rights, and that this relinquishment of
rights covers all their heirs and successors.

The above
relinquishment of rights applies worldwide and includes media and
formats now known or created in the future.

3.2 Waiver of rights and
claims in Copyright and Database Rights when Section 3.1 dedication
inapplicable. If the dedication in Section 3.1 does not apply in the
relevant jurisdiction under Section 6.4, the Rightsholder waives any
rights and claims that the Rightsholder may have or acquire in the
future over the Work in:

     a. Copyright; and

     b. Database
Rights.

To the extent possible in the relevant jurisdiction, the
above waiver of rights and claims applies worldwide and includes media
and formats now known or created in the future. The Rightsholder
agrees not to assert the above rights and waives the right to enforce
them over the Work.

3.3 Licence of Copyright and Database Rights when
Sections 3.1 and 3.2 inapplicable. If the dedication and waiver in
Sections 3.1 and 3.2 does not apply in the relevant jurisdiction under
Section 6.4, the Rightsholder and You agree as follows:

     a. The
Licensor grants to You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive,
licence to Use the Work for the duration of any applicable Copyright
and Database Rights. These rights explicitly include commercial use,
and do not exclude any field of endeavour. To the extent possible in
the relevant jurisdiction, these rights may be exercised in all media
and formats whether now known or created in the future.

3.4 Moral
rights. This section covers moral rights, including the right to be
identified as the author of the Work or to object to treatment that
would otherwise prejudice the author’s honour and reputation, or any
other derogatory treatment:

     a. For jurisdictions allowing waiver
of moral rights, Licensor waives all moral rights that Licensor may
have in the Work to the fullest extent possible by the law of the
relevant jurisdiction under Section 6.4;

     b. If waiver of moral
rights under Section 3.4 a in the relevant jurisdiction is not
possible, Licensor agrees not to assert any moral rights over the Work
and waives all claims in moral rights to the fullest extent possible
by the law of the relevant jurisdiction under Section 6.4; and

    
c. For jurisdictions not allowing waiver or an agreement not to assert
moral rights under Section 3.4 a and b, the author may retain their
moral rights over the copyrighted aspects of the Work.

Please note
that some jurisdictions do not allow for the waiver of moral rights,
and so moral rights may still subsist over the work in some
jurisdictions.

4.0 Relationship to other rights

4.1 No other
contractual conditions. The Rightsholder makes this Work available to
You without any other contractual obligations, either express or
implied. Any Community Norms statement associated with the Work is not
a contract and does not form part of this Document.

4.2 Relationship
to patents. This Document does not grant You a licence for any patents
that the Rightsholder may own. Users of this Database are cautioned
that they may have to clear other rights or consult other
licences.

4.3 Relationship to trade marks. This Document does not
grant You a licence for any trade marks that the Rightsholder may own
or that the Rightsholder may use to cover the Work. Users of this
Database are cautioned that they may have to clear other rights or
consult other licences. Part III: General provisions

5.0 Warranties,
disclaimer, and limitation of liability

5.1 The Work is provided by
the Rightsholder ""as is"" and without any warranty of any kind, either
express or implied, whether of title, of accuracy or completeness, of
the presence of absence of errors, of fitness for purpose, or
otherwise. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of implied
warranties, so this exclusion may not apply to You.

5.2 Subject to
any liability that may not be excluded or limited by law, the
Rightsholder is not liable for, and expressly excludes, all liability
for loss or damage however and whenever caused to anyone by any use
under this Document, whether by You or by anyone else, and whether
caused by any fault on the part of the Rightsholder or not. This

exclusion applies even if the Rightsholder has been advised of the
possibility of such damages.

5.3 If liability may not be excluded by
law, it is limited to actual and direct financial loss to the extent
it is caused by proved negligence on the part of the
Rightsholder.

     2.1. The Initial Developer
Grant. The Initial Developer hereby grants You a world-wide,
royalty-free, non-exclusive license, subject to third party
intellectual property claims:

          (a) to use, reproduce,
modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute the Original Code
(or portions thereof) with or without Modifications, or as part of a
Larger Work; and

          (b) under patents now or hereafter owned
or controlled by Initial Developer, to make, have made, use and sell
(""Utilize"") the Original Code (or portions thereof), but solely to the
extent that any such patent is reasonably necessary to enable You to
Utilize the Original Code (or portions thereof) and not to any greater
extent that may be necessary to Utilize further Modifications or
combinations.

     2.2. Contributor Grant. Each Contributor hereby
grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license, subject
to third party intellectual property claims:

          (a) to use,
reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute the

on an unmodified basis, with other Modifications, as Covered Code or
as part of a Larger Work; and

          (b) under patents now or
hereafter owned or controlled by Contributor, to Utilize the
Contributor Version (or portions thereof), but solely to the extent
that any such patent is reasonably necessary to enable You to Utilize
the Contributor Version (or portions thereof), and not to any greater
extent that may be necessary to Utilize further Modifications or
combinations.

3. DISTRIBUTION OBLIGATIONS

     3.1. Application of
License. The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute
are governed by the terms of this License, including without
limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be
distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version
of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a
copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You
distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code
version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this
License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include
an additional document offering the additional rights described in
Section 3.5.

     3.2. Availability of Source Code. Any Modification
which You create or to which You contribute must be made available in
Source Code form under the terms of this License via an accepted
Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an
Executable version available and to the Initial Developer; and if made
available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must remain available
for at least twelve (12) months after the date it initially became
available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent version of
that particular Modification has been made available to such
recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code
version remains available even if the Electronic Distribution
Mechanism is maintained by a third party. You are responsible for
notifying the Initial Developer of the Modification and the location
of the Source if a contact means is provided. Red Hat will be acting
as maintainer of the Source and may provide an Electronic Distribution
mechanism for the Modification to be made available. You can contact
Red Hat to make the Modification available and to notify the Initial
Developer. (http://sourceware.cygnus.com/ecos/)

     3.3. Description
of Modifications. You must cause all Covered Code to which you
contribute to contain a file documenting the changes You made to
create that Covered Code and the date of any change. You must include
a prominent statement that the Modification is derived, directly or
indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial Developer and
including the name of the Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code,
and (b) in any notice in an Executable version or related
documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership of the
Covered Code.

     3.4. Intellectual Property Matters

          (a)
Third Party Claims.  If You have knowledge that a party claims an
intellectual property right in particular functionality or code (or
its utilization under this License), you must include a text file with
the source code distribution titled ""LEGAL"" which describes the claim
and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient
will know whom to contact. If you obtain such knowledge after You make
Your Modification available as described in Section 3.2, You shall
promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies You make available
thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate
mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who
received the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.

     
    (b) Contributor APIs. If Your Modification is an application
programming interface and You own or control patents which are
reasonably necessary to implement that API, you must also include this
information in the LEGAL file.

     3.5. Required Notices. You must
duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code, and
this License in any documentation for the Source Code, where You
describe recipients' rights relating to Covered Code. If You created
one or more Modification(s), You may add your name as a Contributor to
the Source Code. If it is not possible to put such notice in a
particular Source Code file due to its structure, then you must
include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory file)
where a user would be likely to look for such a notice. You may choose
to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or
liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code.

    
However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of
the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely
clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability
obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify
the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred
by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty,
support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.

     3.6.
Distribution of Executable Versions. You may distribute Covered Code
in Executable form only if the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have
been met for that Covered Code, and if You include a notice stating
that the Source Code version of the Covered Code is available under
the terms of this License, including a description of how and where
You have fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be
conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable version, related
documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients' rights
relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable
version of Covered Code under a license of Your choice, which may
contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in
compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the
Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's
rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this
License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different
license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ
from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial
Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the
Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by
the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such
terms You offer.

     If you distribute executable versions
containing Covered Code, you must reproduce the notice in Exhibit B in
the documentation and/or other materials provided with the product.

 
   3.7. Larger Works. You may create a Larger Work by combining
Covered Code with other code not governed by the terms of this License
and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case,
You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for
the Covered Code.

4. INABILITY TO COMPLY DUE TO STATUTE OR
REGULATION

If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the
terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code
due to statute or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms
of this License to the maximum extent possible; (b) cite the statute
or regulation that prohibits you from adhering to the license; and (c)
describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description
must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must
be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the
extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be
sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to
understand it. You must submit this LEGAL file to Red Hat for review,
and You will not be able use the covered code in any means until
permission is granted from Red Hat to allow for the inability to
comply due to statute or regulation.

5. APPLICATION OF THIS
LICENSE

This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer
has attached the notice in Exhibit A, and to related Covered
Code.

Red Hat may include Covered Code in products without such
additional products becoming subject to the terms of this License, and
may license such additional products on different terms from those
contained in this License.

Red Hat may license the Source Code of Red
Hat Branded Code without Red Hat Branded Code becoming subject to the
terms of this License, and may license Red Hat Branded Code on
different terms from those contained in this License. Contact Red Hat
for details of alternate licensing terms available.

6. VERSIONS OF
THE LICENSE

     6.1. New Versions. Red Hat may publish revised
and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version
will be given a distinguishing version number.

     6.2. Effect of
New Versions. Once Covered Code has been published under a particular
version of the License, You may always continue to use it under the
terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code
under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by
Red Hat. No one other than Red Hat has the right to modify the terms
applicable to Covered Code beyond what is granted under this and
subsequent Licenses.

     6.3. Derivative Works. If you create or use
a modified version of this License (which you may only do in order to
apply it to code which is not already Covered Code governed by this
License), you must (a) rename Your license so that the phrases ""ECOS"",
""eCos"", ""Red Hat"", ""RHEPL"" or any confusingly similar phrase do not
appear anywhere in your license and (b) otherwise make it clear that
your version of the license contains terms which differ from the Red
Hat eCos Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial
Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in
Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of
this License.)

7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY

COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED
UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN ""AS IS"" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES
THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE
QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY
COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL
DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY
SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY
CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED
CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

8.
TERMINATION

This License and the rights granted hereunder will
terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and
fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the
breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted
shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by
their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this
License shall survive.

9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

UNDER NO
CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING
NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY
OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER
OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY OTHER PERSON FOR ANY
INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY
CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL,
WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER
COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN
INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF
LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY
RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW
PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE
EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO
THAT EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

10. U.S.
GOVERNMENT END USERS

The Covered Code is a ""commercial item,"" as that
term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of
""commercial computer software"" and ""commercial computer software
documentation,"" as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept.
1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1
through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire
Covered Code with only those rights set forth herein.

11.
MISCELLANEOUS

This License represents the complete agreement
concerning subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is
held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the
extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be
governed by California law provisions (except to the extent applicable
law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law
provisions. With respect to disputes in which at least one party is a
citizen of, or an entity chartered or registered to do business in,
the United States of America: (a) unless otherwise agreed in writing,
all disputes relating to this License (excepting any dispute relating
to intellectual property rights) shall be subject to final and binding
arbitration, with the losing party paying all costs of arbitration;
(b) any arbitration relating to this Agreement shall be held in Santa
Clara County, California, under the auspices of JAMS/EndDispute; and

jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern District of
California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County, California, with
the losing party responsible for costs, including without limitation,
court costs and reasonable attorneys fees and expenses. The
application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the
International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or
regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be
construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License.

12.
RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS

Except in cases where another Contributor
has failed to comply with Section 3.4, You are responsible for damages
arising, directly or indirectly, out of Your utilization of rights
under this License, based on the number of copies of Covered Code you
made available, the revenues you received from utilizing such rights,
and other relevant factors. You agree to work with affected parties to
distribute responsibility on an equitable basis.

13. ADDITIONAL TERMS
APPLICABLE TO THE RED HAT ECOS PUBLIC LICENSE

Nothing in this License
shall be interpreted to prohibit Red Hat from licensing under
different terms than this License any code which Red Hat otherwise
would have a right to license.

Obligation - To the extent that Red Hat is limited contractually from
making third party code available under this License, Red Hat may
choose to integrate such third party code into Covered Code without
being required to distribute such third party code in Source Code

entity

2. Source Code License.

2.1 The Initial Developer Grant. The
Initial Developer hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,
non-exclusive license, subject to third party intellectual property
claims: 
     (a) under intellectual property rights (other than
patent or trademark) Licensable by Initial Developer to use,
reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute the
Original Code (or portions thereof) with or without Modifications,
and/or as part of a Larger Work; and 
     (b) under Patents Claims
infringed by the making, using or selling of Original Code, to make,
have made, use, practice, sell, and offer for sale, and/or otherwise
dispose of the Original Code (or portions thereof). 
     (c) the
licenses granted in this Section 2.1(a) and (b) are effective on the
date Initial Developer first distributes Original Code under the terms
of this License. 
     (d) Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no
patent license is granted: 1) for code that You delete from the
Original Code; 2) separate from the Original Code; or 3) for
infringements caused by: i) the modification of the Original Code or
ii) the combination of the Original Code with other software or
devices.

2.2 Contributor Grant. Subject to third party intellectual
property claims, each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide,
royalty-free, non-exclusive license 
     (a) under intellectual
property rights (other than patent or trademark) Licensable by
Contributor, to use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense
and distribute the Modifications created by such Contributor (or
portions thereof) either on an unmodified basis, with other
Modifications, as Covered Code and/or as part of a Larger Work; and 
 
   (b) under Patent Claims infringed by the making, using, or selling
of Modifications made by that Contributor either alone and/or in
combination with its Contributor Version (or portions of such
combination), to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, and/or
otherwise dispose of: 1) Modifications made by that Contributor (or
portions thereof); and 2) the combination of Modifications made by
that Contributor with its Contributor Version (or portions of such
combination). 
     (c) the licenses granted in Sections 2.2(a) and
2.2(b) are effective on the date Contributor first makes Commercial
Use of the Covered Code. 
     (d) Notwithstanding Section 2.2(b)
above, no patent license is granted: 1) for any code that Contributor
has deleted from the Contributor Version; 2) separate from the
Contributor Version; 3) for infringements caused by: i) third party
modifications of Contributor Version or ii) the combination of
Modifications made by that Contributor with other software (except as
part of the Contributor Version) or other devices; or 4) under Patent
Claims infringed by Covered Code in the absence of Modifications made
by that Contributor.

3. Distribution Obligations.

3.1 Application of
License. The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute
are governed by the terms of this License, including without
limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be
distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version
of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a
copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You
distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code
version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this
License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include
an additional document offering the additional rights described in
Section 3.5.  

3.2 Availability of Source Code. Any Modification
which You create or to which You contribute must be made available in
Source Code form under the terms of this License either on the same
media as an Executable version or via an accepted Electronic
Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable
version available; and if made available via Electronic Distribution
Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after
the date it initially became available, or at least six (6) months
after a subsequent version of that particular Modification has been
made available to such recipients. You are responsible for ensuring
that the Source Code version remains available even if the Electronic
Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.  

3.3
Description of Modifications. You must cause all Covered Code to which
You contribute to contain a file documenting the changes You made to
create that Covered Code and the date of any change. You must include
a prominent statement that the Modification is derived, directly or
indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial Developer and
including the name of the Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code,
and (b) in any notice in an Executable version or related
documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership of the
Covered Code.  

3.4 Intellectual Property Matters. 
     (a) Third
Party Claims. If Contributor has actual knowledge that a license under
a third party's intellectual property rights is required to exercise
the rights granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2,
Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code distribution
titled ""LEGAL"" which describes the claim and the party making the
claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact.
If Contributor obtains such knowledge after the Modification is made
available as described in Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly
modify the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor makes available
thereafter. 
     (b) Contributor API's. If Contributor's
Modifications include an application programming interface and
Contributor has actual knowledge of patent licenses which are
reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must also
include this information in the LEGAL file. 
     (c) Representations.
Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section
3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's Modifications
are Contributor's original creation(s) and/or Contributor has
sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.  

3.5
Required Notices. You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each
file of the Source Code. If it is not possible to put such notice in a
particular Source Code file due to its structure, then You must
include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory) where
a user would be most likely to look for such a notice. If You created
one or more Modification(s) You may add your name as a Contributor to
the notice described in Exhibit A. You must also duplicate this
License in any documentation for the Source Code where You describe
recipients' rights or ownership rights relating to Covered Code. You
may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of
Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not
on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make
it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or
liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to
indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any
liability (excluding any liability arising from intellectual property
claims relating to the Covered Code) incurred by the Initial Developer
or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or
liability terms You offer.  

3.6 Distribution of Executable Versions.
You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the
requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code,
and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of
the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License,
including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the
obligation of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included
in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or
collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the
Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered
Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may
contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in
compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the
Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's
rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this
License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different
license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ
from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial
Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the
Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability (excluding
any liability arising from intellectual property claims relating to
the Covered Code) incurred by the Initial Developer or such
Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.  

3.7 Larger
Works. You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with
other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute
the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make
sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered
Code.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation. If it is
impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License
with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute,
judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms
of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the
limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be
included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must be
included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the
extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be
sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to
understand it.

5. Application of this License. This License applies
to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the notice in
Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.

6. Versions of the
License.

6.1 New Versions. The Storage Networking Industry
Association (the ""SNIA"") may publish revised and/or new versions of
the License from time to time. Each version will be given a
distinguishing version number.  

6.2 Effect of New Versions. Once
Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the
License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that
version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms
of any subsequent version of the License published by the SNIA. No one
other than the SNIA has the right to modify the terms applicable to
Covered Code created under this License.  

6.3 Derivative Works. If
You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may
only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code
governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your license so that
the phrases ""Storage Networking Industry Association,"" ""SNIA,"" or any
confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your license (except to
note that your license differs from this License) and (b) otherwise
make it clear that Your version of the license contains terms which
differ from the SNIA Public License. (Filling in the name of the
Initial Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice
described in Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be
modifications of this License.)

7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. COVERED
CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN ""AS IS"" BASIS, WITHOUT
WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS,
MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE
ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS
WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU
(NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST
OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF
WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY
COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

8.
TERMINATION.

8.1 This License and the rights granted hereunder will
terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and
fail to cure such breach within a reasonable time after becoming aware
of the breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly
granted shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions
which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination
of this License shall survive.  

8.2 If You initiate litigation by
asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment
actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial
Developer or Contributor against whom You file such action is referred
to as ""Participant"") alleging that: o (a) such Participant's
Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then
any and all rights granted by such Participant to You under Sections
2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from
Participant terminate prospectively, unless if within 60 days after
receipt of notice You either: (i) agree in writing to pay Participant
a mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and future use
of Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your
litigation claim with respect to the Contributor Version against such
Participant. If within 60 days of notice, a reasonable royalty and
payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the
parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted
by Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically
terminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice period specified
above.  

8.3 If You assert a patent infringement claim against
Participant alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version
directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is
resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of
patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the
licenses granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall
be taken into account in determining the amount or value of any
payment or license.  

8.4 In the event of termination under Sections
8.1 or 8.2 above, all end user license agreements (excluding
distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or
any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive
termination.

9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND
UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT,
OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR,
OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH
PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL,
INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING,
WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE,
COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL
DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT
APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH
PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH
LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR
LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION
AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.
The Covered Code is a ""commercial item,"" as that term is defined in 48
C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of ""commercial computer software""
and ""commercial computer software documentation,"" as such terms are
used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R.
12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all
U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those rights
set forth herein.

11. MISCELLANEOUS This License represents the
complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof. If any provision
of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be
reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This
License shall be governed by California law provisions (except to the
extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding its
conflict-of-law provisions. The application of the United Nations
Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is
expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the
language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall
not apply to this License.

12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS. As between
Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible for
claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its
utilization of rights under this License and You agree to work with
Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such responsibility
on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed
to constitute any admission of liability.

13. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE.
Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as
""Multiple-Licensed"". ""Multiple-Licensed"" means that the Initial
Developer permits you to utilize portions of the Covered Code under
Your choice of this License or the alternative licenses, if any,
specified by the Initial Developer in the file described in Exhibit
A.

14. ACCEPTANCE. This License is accepted by You if You retain,
use, or distribute the Covered Code for any purpose.

Preamble

This Simple Public License
2.0 (SimPL 2.0 for short) is a plain language implementation of GPL
2.0.  The words are different, but the goal is the same - to guarantee
for all users the freedom to share and change software.  If anyone
wonders about the meaning of the SimPL, they should interpret it as
consistent with GPL 2.0.

Simple Public License (SimPL) 2.0

The SimPL
applies to the software's source and object code and comes with any
rights that I have in it (other than trademarks). You agree to the
SimPL by copying, distributing, or making a derivative work of the
software.

You get the royalty free right to:
     
- Use the software
for any purpose;
- Make derivative works of it (this is called a
""Derived Work"");
- Copy and distribute it and any Derived Work.

If
you distribute the software or a Derived Work, you must give back to
the community by:

- Prominently noting the date of any changes you
make;
- Leaving other people's copyright notices, warranty
disclaimers, and license terms  in place;
- Providing the source code,
build scripts, installation scripts, and interface definitions in a
form that is easy to get and best to modify;
- Licensing it to
everyone under SimPL, or substantially similar terms (such as GPL
2.0), without adding further restrictions to the rights provided;
-
Conspicuously announcing that it is available under that
license.

There are some things that you must shoulder:

- You get NO
WARRANTIES. None of any kind;
- If the software damages you in any
way, you may only recover direct damages up to the amount you paid for
it (that is zero if you did not pay anything). You may not recover any
other damages, including those called ""consequential damages."" (The
state or country where you live may not allow you to limit your
liability in this way, so this may not apply to you);

The SimPL
continues perpetually, except that your license rights end
automatically if:

- You do not abide by the ""give back to the
community"" terms (your licensees get to keep their rights if they
abide);

I) There are no restrictions on distributing unmodified
copies of Vim except that they must include this license text. You can
also distribute unmodified parts of Vim, likewise unrestricted except
that they must include this license text. You are also allowed to
include executables that you made from the unmodified Vim sources,
plus your own usage examples and Vim scripts.

II) It is allowed to
distribute a modified (or extended) version of Vim, including
executables and/or source code, when the following four conditions are
met: 

     1) This license text must be included unmodified. 

    
2) The modified Vim must be distributed in one of the following five
ways:
 
          a) If you make changes to Vim yourself, you must
clearly describe in the distribution how to contact you. When the
maintainer asks you (in any way) for a copy of the modified Vim you
distributed, you must make your changes, including source code,
available to the maintainer without fee. The maintainer reserves the
right to include your changes in the official version of Vim. What the
maintainer will do with your changes and under what license they will
be distributed is negotiable. If there has been no negotiation then
this license, or a later version, also applies to your changes. The
current maintainer is Bram Moolenaar <Bram@vim.org>. If this changes
it will be announced in appropriate places (most likely vim.sf.net,
www.vim.org and/or comp.editors). When it is completely impossible to
contact the maintainer, the obligation to send him your changes
ceases. Once the maintainer has confirmed that he has received your
changes they will not have to be sent again. 

          b) If you
have received a modified Vim that was distributed as mentioned under
a) you are allowed to further distribute it unmodified, as mentioned
at I). If you make additional changes the text under a) applies to
those changes. 

          c) Provide all the changes, including
source code, with every copy of the modified Vim you distribute. This
may be done in the form of a context diff. You can choose what license
to use for new code you add. The changes and their license must not
restrict others from making their own changes to the official version
of Vim. 

          d) When you have a modified Vim which includes
changes as mentioned under c), you can distribute it without the
source code for the changes if the following three conditions are met:

          - The license that applies to the changes permits you to
distribute the changes to the Vim maintainer without fee or
restriction, and permits the Vim maintainer to include the changes in
the official version of Vim without fee or restriction. 
          -
You keep the changes for at least three years after last distributing
the corresponding modified Vim. When the maintainer or someone who you
distributed the modified Vim to asks you (in any way) for the changes
within this period, you must make them available to him. 
          -
You clearly describe in the distribution how to contact you. This
contact information must remain valid for at least three years after
last distributing the corresponding modified Vim, or as long as
possible. 

          e) When the GNU General Public License (GPL)
applies to the changes, you can distribute the modified Vim under the
GNU GPL version 2 or any later version. 

     3) A message must be
added, at least in the output of the "":version"" command and in the
intro screen, such that the user of the modified Vim is able to see
that it was modified. When distributing as mentioned under 2)e) adding
the message is only required for as far as this does not conflict with
the license used for the changes. 

     4) The contact information as
required under 2)a) and 2)d) must not be removed or changed, except
that the person himself can make corrections.

III) If you distribute
a modified version of Vim, you are encouraged to use the Vim license
for your changes and make them available to the maintainer, including
the source code. The preferred way to do this is by e-mail or by
uploading the files to a server and e-mailing the URL. If the number
of changes is small (e.g., a modified Makefile) e-mailing a context
diff will do. The e-mail address to be used is <maintainer@vim.org>


IV) It is not allowed to remove this license from the distribution
of the Vim sources, parts of it or from a modified version. You may
use this license for previous Vim releases instead of the license that
they came with, at your option.

This Yahoo! Public License
(this ""Agreement"") is a legal agreement that describes the terms under
which Yahoo! Inc., a Delaware corporation having its principal place
of business at 701 First Avenue, Sunnyvale, California 94089
(""Yahoo!"") will provide software to you via download or otherwise
(""Software""). By using the Software, you, an individual or an entity
(""You"") agree to the terms of this Agreement.

In consideration of the
mutual promises and upon the terms and conditions set forth below, the
parties agree as follows:

1. Grant of Copyright License
	
     1.1 -
Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Yahoo! hereby
grants to You, under any and all of its copyright interest in and to
the Software, a royalty-free, non-exclusive, non-transferable license
to copy, modify, compile, execute, and distribute the Software and
Modifications. For the purposes of this Agreement, any change to,
addition to, or abridgement of the Software made by You is a
""Modification;"" however, any file You add to the Software that does
not contain any part of the Software is not a ""Modification.""
	
    
1.2 - If You are an individual acting on behalf of a corporation or
other entity, Your use of the Software or any Modification is subject
to Your having the authority to bind such corporation or entity to
this Agreement. Providing copies to persons within such corporation or
entity is not considered distribution for purposes of this
Agreement.
	
     1.3 - For the Software or any Modification You
distribute in source code format, You must do so only under the terms
of this Agreement, and You must include a complete copy of this
Agreement with Your distribution. With respect to any Modification You
distribute in source code format, the terms of this Agreement will
apply to You in the same way those terms apply to Yahoo! with respect
to the Software. In other words, when You are distributing
Modifications under this Agreement, You ""stand in the shoes"" of Yahoo!
in terms of the rights You grant and how the terms and conditions
apply to You and the licensees of Your Modifications. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, when You ""stand in the shoes"" of Yahoo!, You are not
subject to the jurisdiction provision under Section 7, which requires
all disputes under this Agreement to be subject to the jurisdiction of
federal or state courts of northern California.
	
     1.4 - For the
Software or any Modification You distribute in compiled or object code
format, You must also provide recipients with access to the Software
or Modification in source code format along with a complete copy of
this Agreement. The distribution of the Software or Modifications in
compiled or object code format may be under a license of Your choice,
provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this Agreement.
In addition, You must make absolutely clear that any license terms
applying to such Software or Modification that differ from this
Agreement are offered by You alone and not by Yahoo!, and that such
license does not restrict recipients from exercising rights in the
source code to the Software granted by Yahoo! under this Agreement or
rights in the source code to any Modification granted by You as
described in Section 1.3.
	
     1.5 - This Agreement does not limit
Your right to distribute files that are entirely Your own work (i.e.,
which do not incorporate any portion of the Software and are not
Modifications) under any terms You choose.

2. Support
Yahoo! has no
obligation to provide technical support or updates to You. Nothing in
this Agreement requires Yahoo! to enter into any license with You for
any other edition of the Software.

3.  Intellectual Property
Rights
	
     3.1 - Except for the license expressly granted under
copyright in Section 1.1, no rights, licenses or forbearances are
granted or may arise in relation to this Agreement whether expressly,
by implication, exhaustion, estoppel or otherwise. All rights,
including all intellectual property rights, that are not expressly
granted under this Agreement are hereby reserved.
	
     3.2 - In any
copy of the Software or in any Modification you create, You must
retain and reproduce, any and all copyright, patent, trademark, and
attribution notices that are included in the Software in the same form
as they appear in the Software. This includes the preservation of
attribution notices in the form of trademarks or logos that exist
within a user interface of the Software.
	
     3.3 - This license
does not grant You rights to use any party's name, logo, or
trademarks, except solely as necessary to comply with Section 3.2.

4.
 Disclaimer of Warranties
THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED ""AS IS"" AND WITHOUT
WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. YAHOO! MAKES NO WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS,
IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY REGARDING OR RELATING TO THE SOFTWARE.
SPECIFICALLY, YAHOO! DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE SOFTWARE WILL BE ERROR
FREE OR WILL PERFORM IN AN UNINTERRUPTED MANNER. TO THE GREATEST
EXTENT ALLOWED BY LAW, YAHOO! SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS ALL IMPLIED
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE (EVEN
IF YAHOO! HAD BEEN INFORMED OF SUCH PURPOSE), AND NONINFRINGEMENT WITH
RESPECT TO THE SOFTWARE, ANY MODIFICATIONS THERETO AND WITH RESPECT TO
THE USE OF THE FOREGOING.

5.  Limitation of Liability
IN NO EVENT
WILL YAHOO! BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,
EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND (INCLUDING WITHOUT
LIMITATION LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF USE, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS
OF DATA, COST OF COVER) IN CONNECTION WITH OR ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THE FURNISHING, PERFORMANCE OR USE OF THE SOFTWARE OR ANY
OTHER RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, WHETHER ALLEGED AS A BREACH OF
CONTRACT OR TORTIOUS CONDUCT, INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE, AND EVEN IF YAHOO!
HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

6.  Term and
Termination
	
     6.1 - This Agreement will continue in effect unless
and until terminated earlier pursuant to this Section 6.
	
     6.2 -
In the event Yahoo! determines that You have breached this Agreement,
Yahoo! may terminate this Agreement.
	
     6.3 - All licenses granted
hereunder shall terminate upon the termination of this Agreement.
Termination will be in addition to any rights and remedies available
to Yahoo! at law or equity or under this Agreement.
	
     6.4 -
Termination of this Agreement will not affect the provisions regarding
reservation of rights (Section 3.1), provisions disclaiming or
limiting Yahoo!'s liability (Sections 4 and 5), Termination (Section
6) or Miscellaneous (Section 7), which provisions will survive
termination of this Agreement.

7.  Miscellaneous
This Agreement
contains the entire agreement of the parties with respect to the
subject matter of this Agreement and supersedes all previous
communications, representations, understandings and agreements, either
oral or written, between the parties with respect to said subject
matter. The relationship of the parties hereunder is that of
independent contractors, and this Agreement will not be construed as
creating an agency, partnership, joint venture or any other form of
legal association between the parties. If any term, condition, or
provision in this Agreement is found to be invalid, unlawful or
unenforceable to any extent, this Agreement will be construed in a
manner that most closely effectuates the intent of this Agreement.
Such invalid term, condition or provision will be severed from the
remaining terms, conditions and provisions, which will continue to be
valid and enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law. This
Agreement will be interpreted and construed in accordance with the
laws of the State of California and the United States of America,
without regard to conflict of law principles. The U.N. Convention on
Contracts for the International Sale of Goods shall not apply to this
Agreement. All disputes arising out of this Agreement involving Yahoo!
or any of its subsidiaries shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the
federal or state courts of northern California, with venue lying in
Santa Clara County, California. No rights may be assigned, no
obligations may be delegated, and this Agreement may not be
transferred by You, in whole or in part, whether voluntary or by
operation of law, including by way of sale of assets, merger or
consolidation, without the prior written consent of Yahoo!, and any
purported assignment, delegation or transfer without such consent
shall be void ab initio. Any waiver of the provisions of this
Agreement or of a party's rights or remedies under this Agreement must
be in writing to be effective. Failure, neglect or delay by a party to
enforce the provisions of this Agreement or its rights or remedies at
any time, will not be construed or be deemed to be a waiver of such
party's rights under this Agreement and will not in any way affect the
validity of the whole or any part of this Agreement or prejudice such
party's right to take subsequent action.

This Zimbra Public License
(this ""Agreement"") is a legal agreement that describes the terms under
which VMware, Inc., a Delaware corporation having its principal place
of business at 3401 Hillview Avenue, Palo Alto, California 94304
(""VMware"") will provide software to you via download or otherwise
(""Software""). By using the Software, you, an individual or an entity
(""You"") agree to the terms of this Agreement.

In consideration of the
mutual promises and upon the terms and conditions set forth below, the
parties agree as follows:

1. Grant of Copyright License

     1.1 -
Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, VMware hereby
grants to You, under any and all of its copyright interest in and to
the Software, a royalty-free, non-exclusive, non-transferable license
to copy, modify, compile, execute, and distribute the Software and
Modifications. For the purposes of this Agreement, any change to,
addition to, or abridgement of the Software made by You is a
""Modification;"" however, any file You add to the Software that does
not contain any part of the Software is not a ""Modification.""

    
1.2 - If You are an individual acting on behalf of a corporation or
other entity, Your use of the Software or any Modification is subject
to Your having the authority to bind such corporation or entity to
this Agreement. Providing copies to persons within such corporation or
entity is not considered distribution for purposes of this
Agreement.

     1.3 - For the Software or any Modification You
distribute in source code format, You must do so only under the terms
of this Agreement, and You must include a complete copy of this
Agreement with Your distribution. With respect to any Modification You
distribute in source code format, the terms of this Agreement will
apply to You in the same way those terms apply to VMware with respect
to the Software. In other words, when You are distributing
Modifications under this Agreement, You ""stand in the shoes"" of VMware
in terms of the rights You grant and how the terms and conditions
apply to You and the licensees of Your Modifications. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, when You ""stand in the shoes"" of VMware, You are not
subject to the jurisdiction provision under Section 7, which requires
all disputes under this Agreement to be subject to the jurisdiction of
federal or state courts of northern California.

     1.4 - For the
Software or any Modification You distribute in compiled or object code
format, You must also provide recipients with access to the Software
or Modification in source code format along with a complete copy of
this Agreement. The distribution of the Software or Modifications in
compiled or object code format may be under a license of Your choice,
provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this Agreement.
In addition, You must make absolutely clear that any license terms
applying to such Software or Modification that differ from this
Agreement are offered by You alone and not by VMware, and that such
license does not restrict recipients from exercising rights in the
source code to the Software granted by VMware under this Agreement or
rights in the source code to any Modification granted by You as
described in Section 1.3.

     1.5 - This Agreement does not limit
Your right to distribute files that are entirely Your own work (i.e.,
which do not incorporate any portion of the Software and are not
Modifications) under any terms You choose.

2. Support
VMware has no
obligation to provide technical support or updates to You. Nothing in
this Agreement requires VMware to enter into any license with You for
any other edition of the Software.

3. Intellectual Property Rights

 
   3.1 - Except for the license expressly granted under copyright in
Section 1.1, no rights, licenses or forbearances are granted or may
arise in relation to this Agreement whether expressly, by implication,
exhaustion, estoppel or otherwise. All rights, including all
intellectual property rights, that are not expressly granted under
this Agreement are hereby reserved.

     3.2 - In any copy of the
Software or in any Modification you create, You must retain and
reproduce, any and all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution
notices that are included in the Software in the same form as they
appear in the Software. This includes the preservation of attribution
notices in the form of trademarks or logos that exist within a user
interface of the Software.

     3.3 - This license does not grant You
rights to use any party's name, logo, or trademarks, except solely as
necessary to comply with Section 3.2.

4. Disclaimer of Warranties
THE
SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED ""AS IS"" AND WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. VMWARE
MAKES NO WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY REGARDING
OR RELATING TO THE SOFTWARE. SPECIFICALLY, VMWARE DOES NOT WARRANT
THAT THE SOFTWARE WILL BE ERROR FREE OR WILL PERFORM IN AN
UNINTERRUPTED MANNER. TO THE GREATEST EXTENT ALLOWED BY LAW, VMWARE
SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE (EVEN IF VMWARE HAD BEEN INFORMED OF
SUCH PURPOSE), AND NONINFRINGEMENT WITH RESPECT TO THE SOFTWARE, ANY
MODIFICATIONS THERETO AND WITH RESPECT TO THE USE OF THE
FOREGOING.

5. Limitation of Liability
IN NO EVENT WILL VMWARE BE
LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOSS
OF PROFITS, LOSS OF USE, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF DATA, COST OF
COVER) IN CONNECTION WITH OR ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE
FURNISHING, PERFORMANCE OR USE OF THE SOFTWARE OR ANY OTHER RIGHTS
GRANTED HEREUNDER, WHETHER ALLEGED AS A BREACH OF CONTRACT OR TORTIOUS
CONDUCT, INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE, AND EVEN IF VMWARE HAS BEEN ADVISED OF
THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

6. Term and Termination

     6.1 -
This Agreement will continue in effect unless and until terminated
earlier pursuant to this Section 6.

     6.2 - In the event You
violate the terms of this Agreement, VMware may terminate this
Agreement.

     6.3 - All licenses granted hereunder shall terminate
upon the termination of this Agreement. Termination will be in
addition to any rights and remedies available to VMware at law or
equity or under this Agreement.

     6.4 - Termination of this
Agreement will not affect the provisions regarding reservation of
rights (Section 3.1), provisions disclaiming or limiting VMware's
liability (Sections 4 and 5), Termination (Section 6) or Miscellaneous
(Section 7), which provisions will survive termination of this
Agreement.

7. Miscellaneous
This Agreement contains the entire
agreement of the parties with respect to the subject matter of this
Agreement and supersedes all previous communications, representations,
understandings and agreements, either oral or written, between the
parties with respect to said subject matter. The relationship of the
parties hereunder is that of independent contractors, and this
Agreement will not be construed as creating an agency, partnership,
joint venture or any other form of legal association between the
parties. If any term, condition, or provision in this Agreement is
found to be invalid, unlawful or unenforceable to any extent, this
Agreement will be construed in a manner that most closely effectuates
the intent of this Agreement. Such invalid term, condition or
provision will be severed from the remaining terms, conditions and
provisions, which will continue to be valid and enforceable to the
fullest extent permitted by law. This Agreement will be interpreted
and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California
and the United States of America, without regard to conflict of law
principles. The U.N. Convention on Contracts for the International
Sale of Goods shall not apply to this Agreement. All disputes arising
out of this Agreement involving VMware or any of its subsidiaries
shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the federal or state courts of
northern California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County,
California. No rights may be assigned, no obligations may be
delegated, and this Agreement may not be transferred by You, in whole
or in part, whether voluntary or by operation of law, including by way
of sale of assets, merger or consolidation, without the prior written
consent of VMware, and any purported assignment, delegation or
transfer without such consent shall be void ab initio. Any waiver of
the provisions of this Agreement or of a party's rights or remedies
under this Agreement must be in writing to be effective. Failure,
neglect or delay by a party to enforce the provisions of this
Agreement or its rights or remedies at any time, will not be construed
or be deemed to be a waiver of such party's rights under this
Agreement and will not in any way affect the validity of the whole or
any part of this Agreement or prejudice such party's right to take
subsequent action.

This Zimbra Public License
(this “Agreement”) is a legal agreement that describes the terms
under which Zimbra, Inc., a Texas corporation (“Zimbra”) will
provide software to you via download or otherwise (“Software”). By
using the Software, you, an individual or an entity (“You”) agree
to the terms of this Agreement.

In consideration of the mutual
promises and upon the terms and conditions set forth below, the
parties agree as follows:

1. Grant of Copyright License

     1.1 -
Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Zimbra hereby
grants to You, under any and all of its copyright interest in and to
the Software, a royalty-free, non-exclusive, non-transferable license
to copy, modify, compile, execute, and distribute the Software and
Modifications. For the purposes of this Agreement, any change to,
addition to, or abridgement of the Software made by You is a
“Modification;” however, any file You add to the Software that
does not contain any part of the Software is not a
“Modification.”
		
     1.2 - If You are an individual acting on
behalf of a corporation or other entity, Your use of the Software or
any Modification is subject to Your having the authority to bind such
corporation or entity to this Agreement. Providing copies to persons
within such corporation or entity is not considered distribution for
purposes of this Agreement.
		
     1.3 - For the Software or any
Modification You distribute in source code format, You must do so only
under the terms of this Agreement, and You must include a complete
copy of this Agreement with Your distribution. With respect to any
Modification You distribute in source code format, the terms of this
Agreement will apply to You in the same way those terms apply to
Zimbra with respect to the Software. In other words, when You are
distributing Modifications under this Agreement, You “stand in the
shoes” of Zimbra in terms of the rights You grant and how the terms
and conditions apply to You and the licensees of Your Modifications.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, when You “stand in the shoes” of
Zimbra, You are not subject to the jurisdiction provision under
Section 7, which requires all disputes under this Agreement to be
subject to the jurisdiction of federal or state courts of Northern
Texas.
		
     1.4 - For the Software or any Modification You
distribute in compiled or object code format, You must also provide
recipients with access to the Software or Modification in source code
format along with a complete copy of this Agreement. The distribution
of the Software or Modifications in compiled or object code format may
be under a license of Your choice, provided that You are in compliance
with the terms of this Agreement. In addition, You must make
absolutely clear that any license terms applying to such Software or
Modification that differ from this Agreement are offered by You alone
and not by Zimbra, and that such license does not restrict recipients
from exercising rights in the source code to the Software granted by
Zimbra under this Agreement or rights in the source code to any
Modification granted by You as described in Section 1.3.
		
     1.5 -
This Agreement does not limit Your right to distribute files that are
entirely Your own work (i.e., which do not incorporate any portion of
the Software and are not Modifications) under any terms You
choose.
		
2. Support
Zimbra has no obligation to provide technical
support or updates to You. Nothing in this Agreement requires Zimbra
to enter into any license with You for any other edition of the
Software.
		
3. Intellectual Property Rights
		
     3.1 - Except for
the license expressly granted under copyright in Section 1.1, no
rights, licenses or forbearances are granted or may arise in relation
to this Agreement whether expressly, by implication, exhaustion,
estoppel or otherwise. All rights, including all intellectual property
rights, that are not expressly granted under this Agreement are hereby
reserved.
		
     3.2 - In any copy of the Software or in any
Modification you create, You must retain and reproduce any and all
copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices that are
included in the Software in the same form as they appear in the
Software. This includes the preservation of attribution notices in the
form of trademarks or logos that exist within a user interface of the
Software.
		
     3.3 - This license does not grant You rights to use
any party’s name, logo, or trademarks, except solely as necessary to
comply with Section 3.2.

5. Limitation
of Liability

INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF
ANY KIND (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF USE,
BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF DATA, AND COST OF COVER) IN CONNECTION

This is an exerpt from an
email I recieved from the original author, allowing xinetd as
maintained by me (Rob Braun), to use the higher version numbers:

I
appreciate your maintaining the version string guidelines as specified
in the copyright. But I did not mean them to last as long as they
did.

So, if you want, you may use any 2.N.* (N >= 3) version string
for future xinetd versions that you release. Note that I am excluding
the 2.2.* line; using that would only create confusion. Naming the
next release 2.3.0 would put to rest the confusion about 2.2.1 and
2.1.8.*.
