The simplest way to compile this package is:

  1. Type `./configure' to configure the package for your system.  If
     you're using `csh' on an old version of System V, you might need
     to type `sh ./configure' instead to prevent `csh' from trying to
     execute `configure' itself.

     Running `configure' takes awhile.  While running, it prints some
     messages telling which features it is checking for.

  2. Type `make' to compile the package.

  3. Optionally, type `make check' to run any self-tests that come with
     the package.

  4. Type `make install' to install the programs and any data files and
     documentation.

  5. You can remove the program binaries and object files from the
     source code directory by typing `make clean'.  To also remove the
     files that `configure' created (so you can compile the package for
     a different kind of computer), type `make distclean'.  There is
     also a `make maintainer-clean' target, but that is intended mainly
     for the package's developers.  If you use it, you may have to get
     all sorts of other programs in order to regenerate files that came
     with the distribution.

Compilers and Options
=====================

   Some systems require unusual options for compilation or linking that
the `configure' script does not know about.  Run `./configure --help'
for details on some of the pertinent environment variables.

   You can give `configure' initial values for configuration parameters
by setting variables in the command line or in the environment.  Here

   *Note Defining Variables::, for more details.

Compiling For Multiple Architectures
====================================

   You can compile the package for more than one kind of computer at the
same time, by placing the object files for each architecture in their
own directory.  To do this, you must use a version of `make' that
supports the `VPATH' variable, such as GNU `make'.  `cd' to the
directory where you want the object files and executables to go and run
the `configure' script.  `configure' automatically checks for the
source code in the directory that `configure' is in and in `..'.

   If you have to use a `make' that does not support the `VPATH'
variable, you have to compile the package for one architecture at a
time in the source code directory.  After you have installed the
package for one architecture, use `make distclean' before reconfiguring
for another architecture.

   If you are _building_ compiler tools for cross-compiling, you should
use the `--target=TYPE' option to select the type of system they will
produce code for.

   If you want to _use_ a cross compiler, that generates code for a
platform different from the build platform, you should specify the
""host"" platform (i.e., that on which the generated programs will

Eclipse Public License -v 1.0

THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE
PUBLIC LICENSE (""AGREEMENT""). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF
THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.

1. DEFINITIONS

""Contribution"" means:

a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and
documentation distributed under this Agreement, and

b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:

i) changes to the Program, and

ii) additions to the Program;

where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and
are distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution
'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such
Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's
behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the Program which:
(i) are separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with
the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not
derivative works of the Program.

""Contributor"" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.

""Licensed Patents "" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor
which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution
alone or when combined with the Program.

""Program"" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this
Agreement.

""Recipient"" means anyone who receives the Program under this
Agreement, including all Contributors.

2. GRANT OF RIGHTS

a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright
license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display,
publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such
Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and
object code form.

b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent
license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,
import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if
any, in source code and object code form. This patent license shall
apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at
the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition
of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the
Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other
combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is
licensed hereunder.

c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the
licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are
provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the
patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each
Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by
any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights
or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses
granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility
to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For
example, if a third party patent license is required to allow
Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility
to acquire that license before distributing the Program.

d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient
copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright
license set forth in this Agreement.

3. REQUIREMENTS

A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form
under its own license agreement, provided that:

a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and

b) its license agreement:

i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties
and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or
conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or
conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;

ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability
for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and
consequential damages, such as lost profits;

iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are
offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and

iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such
Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable
manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.

When the Program is made available in source code form:

a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and

b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the
Program.

Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained
within the Program.

Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its
Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent
Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.

4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION

Commercial distributors of software may accept certain
responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the
like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use
of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a
commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not
create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a
Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering,
such Contributor (""Commercial Contributor"") hereby agrees to defend
and indemnify every other Contributor (""Indemnified Contributor"")
against any losses, damages and costs (collectively ""Losses"") arising
from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party
against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts
or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its
distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The
obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses
relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property
infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a)
promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim,
and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with
the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement
negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such
claim at its own expense.

For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial
product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial
Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance
claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance
claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility
alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to
defend claims against the other Contributors related to those
performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other
Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor
must pay those damages.

5. NO WARRANTY

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS
PROVIDED ON AN ""AS IS"" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY
KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY
WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY
OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely
responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and
distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its
exercise of rights under this Agreement , including but not limited to
the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable
laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and
unavailability or interruption of operations.

6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR
ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT,
INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING
WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF
LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING
NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR
DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED
HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. GENERAL

If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further
action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the
minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.

If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other
software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such
Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of
the date such litigation is filed.

All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it
fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this
Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of
time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's
rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use
and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably
practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and
any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall
continue and survive.

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,
but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and
may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward
reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of
this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement
Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation
is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign
the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable
separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a
distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions)
may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement
under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the
Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the
Program (including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as
expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives
no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor
under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or
otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this
Agreement are reserved.

This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and
the intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No
party to this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement
more than one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives
its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.

                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 2, June 1991

 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.,
 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The ""Program"", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a ""work based on the Program""
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term ""modification"".)  Each licensee is addressed as ""you"".

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
    parties under the terms of this License.

    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
    customarily used for software interchange; or,

    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
    received the program in object code or executable form with such
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and ""any
later version"", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.

  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

                            NO WARRANTY

  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM ""AS IS"" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

\section{Advanced algorithmic differentiation in ADOL-C}
\label{adv_ad}
%
\subsection{Differentiating parameter dependent functions}
%
Normally the functions to be differentiated using AD are defined as
mappings from $\R^n$ to $\R^m$. The derivatives of the $m$ dependents
are then computed w.r.t. all the $n$ independents. However sometimes
the application requires only derivatives w.r.t. some of the
independents and the others only occur in the evaluation procedure as
parameters. One important such use case is Lagrange Multipliers in a
nonlinear optimization problem. Declaring such variables as
\verb=adouble= and marking them as independent results in the
evaluation of superfluous derivative information and increases
runtime. However, if the parameters are not defined as \verb=adouble=
type variables they get hard coded as constants onto the ADOL-C
trace. One may want to change these parameters for some evaluations,
however the overhead of retracing the function may be very high. In
such cases these constants may be specially marked as parameters
during tracing using the function 
\begin{tabbing}
\hspace{0.5in}\={\sf short int tag;} \hspace{1.1in}\= \kill    % define tab position
\>{\sf mkparam(d)}\\
\>{\sf double d;}         \> // constant value to be marked as parameter \\
\end{tabbing}
This stores the constant in a different place on the trace than the
other unmarked constants and enables the user to replace a whole
vector of parameters with a new one before computing derivatives later
on. All such marked parameter constants can be used in any evaluation
expression where the original unmarked constants were used.

Sometimes the same parameter may be needed in various different
expressions. During trace creation the marked parameters are given a
running index as they are marked. This index may me saved by the user
and used to access the same stored value in different expressions.

To save the index while marking a parameter use
\begin{tabbing}
\hspace{0.5in}\={\sf short int tag;} \hspace{1.1in}\= \kill    % define tab position
\>{\sf locint mkparam\_idx(d)}\\
\>{\sf double d;} \> // constant value to be marked
\end{tabbing}
The resulting \verb=locint= can be saved in a variable by the user and
later used to access the saved parameter from in the trace in any expression

To access a saved parameter inside any evaluation expression use
\begin{tabbing}
\hspace{0.5in}\={\sf short int tag;} \hspace{1.1in}\= \kill    % define tab position
\>{\sf getparam(idx)}\\
\>{\sf locint idx;} \> // index of the parameter as returned by
mkparam\_idx()\\
\end{tabbing}

The above three functions work only during the creation of the trace,

The elements of the array {\sf options} control the action of 
{\sf jac\_pat} according to \autoref{options}.

\end{tabular}
\caption{ {\sf jac\_pat} parameter {\sf options}\label{options}}
\end{table}           
The value of {\sf options[0]} selects the way to compute the sparsity
pattern. The component {\sf options[1]} determines
the usage of the safe or tight mode of bit pattern propagation.
The first, more conservative option is the default. It accounts for all 
dependences that might occur for any value of the
independent variables. For example, the intermediate 
{\sf c}~$=$~{\sf max}$(${\sf a}$,${\sf b}$)$ is
always assumed to depend on all independent variables that {\sf a} or {\sf b}
dependent on, i.e.\ the bit pattern associated with {\sf c} is set to the
logical {\sf OR} of those associated with {\sf a} and {\sf b}. 
In contrast
the tight option gives this result only in the unlikely event of an exact
tie {\sf a}~$=$~{\sf b}. Otherwise it sets the bit pattern
associated with {\sf c} either to that of {\sf a} or to that of {\sf b},
depending on whether {\sf c}~$=$~{\sf a} or {\sf c}~$=$~{\sf b} locally.
Obviously, the sparsity pattern obtained with the tight option may contain
more zeros than that obtained with the safe option. On the other hand, it
will only be valid at points belonging to an area where the function $F$ is locally
analytic and that contains the point at which the internal representation was
generated. Since generating the sparsity structure using the safe version does not
require any reevaluation, it may thus reduce the overall computational cost 
despite the fact that it produces more nonzero entries. The value of
{\sf options[2]} selects the direction of bit pattern propagation. 
Depending on the number of independent $n$ and of dependent variables $m$ 
one would prefer the forward mode if $n$ is significant smaller than $m$ and
would otherwise use the reverse mode.

The routine {\sf jac\_pat} may use the propagation of bitpattern to
determine the sparsity pattern. Therefore, a kind of ``strip-mining'' 
is used to cope with large matrix dimensions. If the system happens to run out of memory, one may reduce 
the value of the constant {\sf PQ\_STRIPMINE\_MAX}
following the instructions in \verb=<adolc/sparse/sparse_fo_rev.h>=.

The driver routine is prototyped in the header file
\verb=<adolc/sparse/sparsedrivers.h>=, which is included automatically by the
global header file \verb=<adolc/adolc.h>= (see 
\autoref{ssec:DesIH}). The determination of sparsity patterns is
illustrated by the examples \verb=sparse_jacobian.cpp=
and \verb=jacpatexam.cpp=

the Jacobian of $F$ at $M$ points it is possible to let each thread perform a 
function evaluation and thus the computation of derivatives for one direction 
at one point. The advantage is that the function is evaluated in different points
in parallel which can result in a faster wallclock runtime.

The following subsection describes the source code modifications required to use 
the traceless forward mode of ADOL-C with Cuda.  

\subsection{Modifying the source code}

Let us again consider the coordinate transformation from Cartesian to spherical
polar coordinates given by the function $F: \mathbb{R}^3 \to \mathbb{R}^3$, $y
= F(x)$, with
\begin{eqnarray*}
y_1  =  \sqrt{x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_3^2},\qquad
y_2  =  \arctan\left(\sqrt{x_1^2 + x_2^2}/x_3\right),\qquad
y_3  =  \arctan(x_2/x_1),
\end{eqnarray*}
as an example. We now calculate the Jacobian at $M=1024$ different points.
The source code for one point is shown in \autoref{fig:traceless}. This example 
has no real application but can still be used to show the combination of the traceless version
of ADOL-C and Cuda.

For the use of this mode a Cuda toolkit, which is suitable for the grafic card used,
has to be installed. Furthermore, it is important to check that the graphic card
used supports double precision (for details see e.g. NVIDIA CUDA C Programming Guide).
Otherwise the data type employed inside of the {\sf adouble} class has to be adapted
to {\sf float}. To use the traceless forward mode with Cuda, one has to include the header
"
/adol-c-v2.6.3.tar.gz/ADOL-C/doc/adolc-manual.tex,LGPL-3.0+,0.041695198383465366,ScoreOutOfRange,1350,1396,65677,68147,0.0008129038345191975,"\>{\sf int n;}                 \> // number of state variables $n$ \\
\>{\sf double tau;}            \> // scaling parameter\\
\>{\sf int deg;}               \> // degree on current call\\
\>{\sf double Z[n][n][deg];}   \> // partials of coefficient vectors\\
\>{\sf double B[n][n][deg];}   \> // result $B$ as defined in \eqref{eq:bees}\\
\>{\sf short nz[n][n];}        \> // optional nonzero pattern 
\end{tabbing}
%
Sparsity information can be exploited by {\sf accode} using the array {\sf
nz}. For this purpose, {\sf nz} has to be set by a call of the routine {\sf
reverse} or the corresponding basic routines as explained below in
\autoref{forw_rev_ad} and \autoref{forw_rev}, respectively. The
non-positive entries of {\sf nz} are then changed by {\sf accode} so that upon
return 
\[
  \mbox{{\sf B[i][j][k]}} \; \equiv \; 0 \quad {\rm if} \quad \mbox{\sf k} \leq \mbox{\sf $-$nz[i][j]}\; . 
\]
In other words, the matrices $B_k$ = {\sf B[ ][ ][k]} have a
sparsity pattern that fills in as $k$ grows. Note, that there need to be no
loss in computational efficiency if a time-dependent ordinary differential equation 
is rewritten in autonomous form. 

The prototype of the ODE-drivers {\sf forode} and {\sf accode} is contained in the header file
\verb=<adolc/drivers/odedrivers.h>=. The global header file
\verb=<adolc/adolc.h>= 
includes this file automatically, see \autoref{ssec:DesIH}.

An example program using the procedures {\sf forode} and {\sf accode} together
with more detailed information about the coding can be found in
\autoref{exam:ode}. The corresponding source code 
\verb=odexam.cpp= is contained in the subdirectory
\verb=examples=.

\subsection{Drivers for Sparse Jacobians and Sparse Hessians}
\label{sparse}
%
Quite often, the Jacobians and Hessians that have to be computed are sparse
matrices. Therefore, ADOL-C provides additionally drivers that 
allow the exploitation of sparsity. The exploitation of sparsity is
frequently based on {\em graph coloring} methods, discussed 
for example in \cite{GeMaPo05} and \cite{GeTaMaPo07}. The sparse drivers of ADOL-C presented in this section
rely on the the coloring package ColPack developed by the authors of \cite{GeMaPo05} and \cite{GeTaMaPo07}.
ColPack is not directly incorporated in ADOL-C, and therefore needs to be installed
separately to use the sparse drivers described here. ColPack is available for download at

square of the degree of the derivative but is still completely
independent of the numbers $m$ and $n$. 

This manual is organized as follows. This section explains the 
modifications required to convert undifferentiated code to code that 
compiles with ADOL-C. 
\autoref{tape} covers aspects of the tape of recorded data that ADOL-C uses to
evaluate arbitrarily high order derivatives. The discussion includes storage 
requirements and the tailoring of certain tape characteristics to fit specific
user needs. Descriptions of easy-to-use drivers for a  convenient derivative 
evaluation are contained in \autoref{drivers}. 
\autoref{forw_rev_ad} offers a more mathematical characterization of
the different modes of AD to compute derivatives. At the same time, the
corresponding drivers of ADOL-C are explained.  
The overloaded derivative evaluation routines using the forward and the reverse
mode of AD are explained in \autoref{forw_rev}. 
Advanced differentiation techniques as the optimal checkpointing for
time integrations, the exploitation of fixed point iterations, the usages
of external differentiated functions and the differentiation of OpenMP
parallel programs are described in \autoref{adv_ad}. 
The tapeless forward mode is presented in \autoref{tapeless}.
\autoref{install} details the installation and 
use of the ADOL-C package. Finally, \autoref{example} 
furnishes some example programs that incorporate the ADOL-C package to 
evaluate first and higher-order
derivatives.  These and other examples are distributed with the ADOL-C
source code.
The user should simply refer to them if the more abstract and general 
descriptions of ADOL-C provided in this document do not suffice.

\>{\sf double S[n][p];} \> // seed matrix\\
\>{\sf int p;} \> // number of columns in $S$
\end{tabbing}
The input variables to {\sf generate\_seed\_hess} are the number of independents $n$
and the sparsity pattern {\sf HP} of the Hessian computed for example
by {\sf hess\_pat}. First, {\sf generate\_seed\_hess} performs an
appropriate coloring of the adjacency graph defined by the sparsity
pattern {\sf HP}: An acyclic coloring in the case of an indirect recovery of the Hessian from its
    compressed representation and a star coloring in the case of a direct recovery.
 Subsequently, {\sf generate\_seed\_hess} allocates the memory needed by {\sf
 S} and initializes {\sf S} according to the graph coloring.
The coloring algorithm applied in {\sf
  generate\_seed\_hess} is used also by the driver {\sf sparse\_hess}
described earlier.

The specific set of criteria used to define a seed matrix $S$ depends
on whether the sparse derivative matrix 
to be computed is a Jacobian (nonsymmetric) or a Hessian (symmetric).  
It also depends on whether the entries of the derivative matrix  are to be
recovered from the compressed representation \emph{directly}
(without requiring any further arithmetic) or \emph{indirectly} (for
example, by solving for unknowns via successive substitutions).
Appropriate recovery routines are provided by ColPack and used 
in the drivers {\sf sparse\_jac} and {\sf sparse\_hess} described in
the previous subsection. Examples with a detailed analysis of the 
employed drivers for the exploitation of sparsity can be found in the
"

The {\sf adouble} default constructor sets to zero the associated value. 
This implies a certain overhead that may seem unnecessary when no initial value 
is actually given, however, 
the implicit initialization of arrays from a partial value list is the only legitimate construct (known to us) that requires this behavior.
An array instantiation such as 
\begin{center}
\sf double x[3]=\{2.0\};
\end{center}
will initialize {\sf x[0]} to {\sf 2.0} and initialize (implicitly) the remaining array elements 
{\sf x[1]} and {\sf x[2]}  to {\sf 0.0}. According to the C++ standard the array element  construction of 
the type changed instantiation 
\begin{center}
\sf adouble x[3]=\{2.0\};
\end{center}
will use the constructor {\sf adouble(const double\&);} for {\sf x[0]} passing in {\sf 2.0} but 
will call the {\sf adouble} default constructor {\sf x[1]} and {\sf x[2]} leaving these array 
elements uninitialized {\em unless} the default constructor does implement the initialization to 
zero. 
The C++ constructor syntax does not provide a means to  distinguish this implicit initialization from the declaration of any simple uninitialized variable.
If the user can ascertain the absence of array instantiations such as the above then one can

/adol-c-v2.6.3.tar.gz/ADOL-C/doc/adolc-manual.tex,EUPL-1.1,0.04363450810448945,ScoreOutOfRange,3915,3994,195988,199390,0.0006479415763651741,"The functions for setting and getting the value and the derivative value of an 
{\sf adouble} are the same as in the traceless version of ADOL-C for first 
order derivatives (see \autoref{tapeless}).
The function evaluation is then performed with {\sf adouble x} on GPU and the results
are saved in {\sf adouble y}. The function evaluation itself remains unchanged
(see \autoref{fig:cudacode3}). Then we store the values of the function
evaluations in each point in a row in one array:
\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{l}
   {\sf \rule{0.5cm}{0pt}outy[(index2*index3+index)*3+i]=y[i].getValue();}\\
  \end{tabular}
\end{center} 
for {\sf i=0,1,2}. The values of a Jacobian are stored column by column in 
a row:
\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{l}
   {\sf \rule{0.5cm}{0pt}outderiv[(index2*index4+index*3+index1)*3+i]=y[i].getADValue();}\\
  \end{tabular}
\end{center} 
for {\sf i=0,1,2}. 

Now there is one thing left to do. The values calculated on the GPU have to be copied 
back to host. For the dependent variables in the example this can be done by the 
following call:
\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{l}
 {\sf \rule{0.5cm}{0pt}cudaMemcpy(y, devy, sizeof(double)*3*M,cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost);}\\
  \end{tabular}
\end{center} 
see \autoref{fig:cudacode1}. The argument {\sf cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost} determines that
the values are copied from GPU to host.

%
\subsection{Compiling and Linking the Source Code}
%
After incorporating the required changes, one has to compile the
source code and link the object files to get the executable. For 
the compilation of a Cuda file the {\sf nvcc} compiler is needed.
The compile sequence should be similar to the following example:
\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{l}
    {\sf nvcc -arch=sm\_20 -o traceless\_cuda traceless\_cuda.cu}
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}
The compiler option \verb#-arch=sm_20# specifies the compute capability that is 
assumed, in this case one that supports double precision.

The mentioned source code {\sf traceless\_cuda.cu} illustrating the use of the
forward traceless scalar mode with Cuda and a further example {\sf liborgpu.cu}
can be found in the directory examples. The second example is an adaption of
the OpenMP example to the traceless version with Cuda.

\section{Installing and Using ADOL-C}
\label{install}
%
\subsection{Generating the ADOL-C Library}
\label{genlib}
%
The currently built system is best summarized by the ubiquitous gnu
install triplet 
\begin{center}
\verb=configure - make - make install= .
\end{center}
Executing this three steps from the package base directory
\verb=</SOMEPATH/=\texttt{\packagetar}\verb=>= will compile the static and the dynamic
ADOL-C library with default options and install the package (libraries
and headers) into the default installation directory {\tt
  \verb=<=\$HOME/adolc\_base\verb=>=}. Inside the install directory
the subdirectory \verb=include= will contain all the installed header
files that may be included by the user program, the subdirectory
\verb=lib= will contain the 32-bit compiled library 
and the subdirectory \verb=lib64= will contain the 64-bit compiled
library. Depending on the compiler only one of \verb=lib= or
\verb=lib64= may be created.

Before doing so the user may modify the header file \verb=usrparms.h=
in order to tailor the \mbox{ADOL-C} package to the needs in the
"

%
% and also the 
%active subscripts described in the \autoref{act_subscr}. 
Ambiguous statements like {\sf a += a++;} must be 
avoided because the compiler may sequence the evaluation of the
overloaded
expression differently from the original in terms of {\sf double}s.

As we have indicated above, all subroutines called with active arguments
must be modified or suitably overloaded. The simplest procedure is
to declare the local variables of the function as active so that
their internal calculations are also recorded on the tape.
Unfortunately, this approach is likely to be unnecessarily inefficient
and inaccurate if the original subroutine evaluates a special function
that is defined as the solution of a particular mathematical problem.
The most important examples are implicit functions, quadratures,
and solutions of ordinary differential equations. Often
the numerical methods for evaluating such special functions are
elaborate, and their internal workings are not at all differentiable in
the data. Rather than differentiating through such an adaptive
procedure, one can obtain first and higher derivatives directly from
the mathematical definition of the special function. Currently this
direct approach has been implemented only for user-supplied quadratures
as described in \autoref{quadrat}.
%
%++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
\subsection{Reusing the Tape for Arbitrary Input Values}
\label{reuse_tape}
%
In some situations it may be desirable to calculate the value and
derivatives of a function at arbitrary arguments by using a tape of
the function evaluation at one argument and reevaluating the
function  and its derivatives using the given ADOL-C
routines. This approach can
significantly reduce run times, and it 
also allows to port problem functions, in the form of the  
corresponding tape files, into a computing environment that
does not support C++ but does support C or Fortran.  
Therefore, the routines provided by ADOL-C for the evaluation of derivatives
can be used to at arguments $x$ other than the
point at which the tape was generated, provided there are
no user defined quadratures and all comparisons involving
{\sf adouble}s yield the same result. The last condition 
implies that the control flow is unaltered by the change
of the independent variable values. Therefore, this sufficient
condition is tested by ADOL-C and if it is not met 
the ADOL-C routine called for derivative calculations indicates this
contingency through its return value. Currently, there are six return values,
see \autoref{retvalues}.

In this example each thread is assigned the task of calculating the 
derivatives in one point with respect to one independent variable. Therefore
some indices are needed for the implementation. Each thread has a unique thread
ID in a block consisting of an x and an y-dimension. The blocks have an ID as
well. In the example the following indices are used.
 
\begin{itemize}
 \item {\sf index = threadIdx.x} denotes the x-dimension of a thread (ranges from 0 to 63 in the example)
 \item {\sf index1 = threadIdx.y} denotes the y-dimension of a thread (ranges from 0 to 2 in the example)
 \item {\sf index2 = blockIdx.x} denotes the block index (ranges from 0 to 15 in the example)
 \item {\sf index3 = blockDim.x} denotes the x-dimension of a block (always 64 in the example)
 \item {\sf index4 = blockDim.x*blockDim.y} denotes the size of a block (always $64*3=192$ in the example)
\end{itemize}

For the calculation of derivatives the function evaluation has to be performed
with {\sf adouble}s. Therefore the dependent and the independent variables
have to be declared as {\sf adouble}s as in the other versions of ADOL-C (see, e.g., \autoref{tapeless}). 
Similar to the traceless version without Cuda the namespace \verb#adtlc# is used. 
Now each thread has to read out the point at which the function evaluation is 
then performed. This is determined by the blockindex and the x-dimension of 
the thread, therefore the independent variables in a thread
have the values
\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{l}
    {\sf \rule{0.5cm}{0pt}x[i]=inx[index2*index4+index*3+i];}\\

if the dependence on the direction is linear. Otherwise,
the directional derivatives are merely positively homogeneous with
respect to the scaling of the directions.
For the reverse mode, ADOL-C sets the derivative of {\sf fabs(x)} at
the origin somewhat arbitrarily to zero.

We have defined binary functions {\sf fmin} and {\sf fmax} for {\sf adouble}
arguments, so that function and derivative values are obtained consistent
with those of {\sf fabs} according to the identities
\[
 \min(a,b) = [a+b-|a-b|]/2 \quad {\rm and} \quad
 \max(a,b) = [a+b+|a-b|]/2 \quad . 
\]
These relations cannot hold if either $a$ or $b$ is infinite, in which
case {\sf fmin} or {\sf fmax} and their derivatives may still be well
defined. It should be noted that the directional differentiation of
{\sf fmin} and {\sf fmax} yields at ties $a=b$ different results from
the corresponding assignment based on the sign of $a-b$. For example,
the statement 
\begin{center}
 {\sf if (a $<$ b) c = a; else c = b;}
\end{center} 
yields for {\sf a}~=~{\sf b} and {\sf a}$^\prime < $~{\sf b}$^\prime$
the incorrect directional derivative value 
{\sf c}$^\prime = $~{\sf  b}$^\prime$ rather than the correct
{\sf c}$^\prime = $~{\sf  a}$^\prime$. Therefore this form of conditional assignment
should be avoided by use of the function $\sf fmin(a,b)$. There
are also versions of {\sf fmin} and {\sf fmax} for two passive 
arguments and mixed passive/active arguments are handled by 
implicit conversion. 
On the function class obtained by composing the modulus with real
analytic functions, the concept of directional differentiation can be
extended to the propagation of unique one-sided Taylor expansions.
The branches taken by {\sf fabs, fmin}, and {\sf fmax}, are recorded 
on the tape.

The first, more conservative option is the default. It accounts for all 
dependences that might occur for any value of the
independent variables. For example, the intermediate 
{\sf c}~$=$~{\sf max}$(${\sf a}$,${\sf b}$)$ is
always assumed to depend on all independent variables that {\sf a} or {\sf b}
dependent on, i.e.\ the bit pattern associated with {\sf c} is set to the
logical {\sf OR} of those associated with {\sf a} and {\sf b}. 
In contrast
the tight option gives this result only in the unlikely event of an exact
tie {\sf a}~$=$~{\sf b}. Otherwise it sets the bit pattern
associated with {\sf c} either to that of {\sf a} or to that of {\sf b},
depending on whether {\sf c}~$=$~{\sf a} or {\sf c}~$=$~{\sf b} locally.
Obviously, the sparsity pattern obtained with the tight option may contain
more zeros than that obtained with the safe option. On the other hand, it
will only be valid at points belonging to an area where the function $F$ is locally
analytic and that contains the point at which the internal representation was
generated. Since generating the sparsity structure using the safe version does not
require any reevaluation, it may thus reduce the overall computational cost 
despite the fact that it produces more nonzero entries. 
The value of {\sf options[2]} selects the direction of bit pattern propagation.
Depending on the number of independent $n$ and of dependent variables $m$ 
one would prefer the forward mode if $n$ is significant smaller than $m$ and
would otherwise use the reverse mode.

 The elements of the array {\sf options} control the action of 
{\sf sparse\_hess} according to \autoref{options_sparse_hess}.

If there is no {\sf else} part in a conditional assignment, one may call
the three argument version 
{\sf condassign(a,b,c)}, which 
is logically equivalent to {\sf condassign(a,b,c,a)} in that
nothing happens if {\sf b} is non-positive.  
The header file \verb=<adolc/adouble.h>=
contains also corresponding definitions of
{\sf condassign(a,b,c,d)} 
and {\sf condassign(a,b,c)} for
passive {\sf double} arguments so that the modified code 
without any differentiation can be tested
for correctness. 

A generalization of this concept for more than two branches, e.g.,
akin to a \texttt{switch} statement or a cascade of \texttt{if...else if}, may be done by enabling
\textsf{ADOLC\_ADVANCED\_BRANCHING} and performing selection on
elements of an \texttt{advector} with active indices.

\subsection{Step-by-Step Modification Procedure}
%
To prepare a section of given C or C++ code for automatic
differentiation as described above, one applies the following step-by-step procedure.
\begin{enumerate}
\item
Use the statements {\sf trace\_on(tag)} or {\sf trace\_on(tag,keep)}
and {\sf trace\_off()} or {\sf trace\_off(file)} to mark the
beginning and end of the active section. 
\item 
Select the set of active variables, and change their type from
{\sf double} or {\sf float} to {\sf adouble}.
\item
Select a sequence of independent variables, and initialize them with
\boldmath $\ll=$ \unboldmath assignments from passive variables or vectors.
\item
Select a sequence of dependent variables among the active variables,
and pass their final values to passive variable or vectors thereof
by \boldmath $\gg=$ \unboldmath assignments.
\item 
Compile the codes after including the header file \verb=<adolc/adouble.h>=. 
\end{enumerate}
Typically, the first compilation will detect several type conflicts
-- usually attempts to convert from active to passive
variables or to perform standard I/O of active variables.
Since all standard
C programs can be activated by a mechanical application of the
procedure above, the following section is of importance
only to advanced users.

\section{Numbering the Tapes and Controlling the Buffer}
\label{tape}
%
The trace generated by the execution of an active section may stay
within a triplet of internal arrays or it may be written out
to three corresponding files. We will refer to these triplets as the 
tape array or tape file, in general tape, which may subsequently be

/adol-c-v2.6.3.tar.gz/ADOL-C/doc/adolc-manual.tex,CECILL-1.1,0.04738987785322958,ScoreOutOfRange,3006,3054,152733,155147,0.00047729052393017274,"Furthermore, frequently there are quantities that influence the
result of the simulation and can be seen as  control of the systems. 
To compute an approximation of the
simulated process for a time interval $[0,T]$ and evaluated the
desired target function, one applies an
appropriate integration scheme given by
\begin{tabbing}
\hspace{5mm} \= some initializations yielding $x_0$\\
\> for $i=0,\ldots, N-1$\\
\hspace{10mm}\= $x_{i+1} = F(x_i,u_i,t_i)$\\
\hspace{5mm} \= evaluation of the target function
\end{tabbing}
where $x_i\in {\bf R}^n$ denotes the state and $u_i\in {\bf R}^m$ the control at
time $t_i$ for a given time grid $t_0,\ldots,t_N$ with $t_0=0$ and
$t_N=T$. The operator $F : {\bf R}^n \times {\bf R}^m \times {\bf R} \mapsto {\bf R}^n$
defines the time step to compute the state at time $t_i$. Note that we
do not assume a uniform grid.

When computing derivatives of the target function with respect to the
control, the consequences for the tape generation using the ``basic''
taping approach as implemented in ADOL-C so far are shown in the left part of
\autoref{fig:bas_tap}. 
\begin{figure}[htbp]

\hspace*{0.8cm} Basic taping process \hspace*{4.3cm} Advanced taping process
\caption{Different taping approaches}
\label{fig:bas_tap}
\end{figure} 
As can be seen, the iterative process is completely
unrolled due to the taping process. That is, the tape contains an internal representation of each 
time step. Hence, the overall tape comprises a serious amount of redundant
information as illustrated by the light grey rectangles in
\autoref{fig:bas_tap}.  

To overcome the repeated storage of essentially the same information, 
a {\em nested taping} mechanism has been incorporated into ADOL-C as illustrated on
the right-hand side of \autoref{fig:bas_tap}. This new
capability allows the encapsulation of the time-stepping procedure
such that only the last time step $x_{N} = F(x_{N-1},u_{N-1})$ is taped as one
representative of the time steps in addition to a function pointer to the 
evaluation procedure $F$ of the time steps.  The function pointer has
to be stored for a possibly necessary retaping during the derivative calculation
as explained below. 

Instead of storing the complete tape, only a very limited number of intermediate

where the OpenMP-parallel loop is preceded by a serial startup
calculation and followed by a serial finalization phase. 

Initialization of the OpenMP-parallel regions for \mbox{ADOL-C} is only a matter of adding a macro to the outermost OpenMP statement.
Two macros are available that only differ in the way the global tape information is handled.
Using {\tt ADOLC\_OPENMP}, this information, including the values of the augmented variables, is always transferred from the serial to the parallel region using {\it firstprivate} directives for initialization.
For the special case of iterative codes where parallel regions, working on the same data structures, are called repeatedly the {\tt ADOLC\_OPENMP\_NC} macro can be used.
Then, the information transfer is performed only once within the iterative process upon encounter of the first parallel region through use of the {\it threadprivate} feature of OpenMP that makes use of thread-local storage, i.e., global memory local to a thread.
Due to the inserted macro, the OpenMP statement has the following structure:
\begin{tabbing}
\hspace*{1cm} \= {\sf \#pragma omp ... ADOLC\_OPENMP} \qquad \qquad or \\
              \> {\sf \#pragma omp ... ADOLC\_OPENMP\_NC}
\end{tabbing}
Inside the parallel region, separate tapes may then be created.
Each single thread works in its own dedicated AD-environment, and all
serial facilities of \mbox{ADOL-C} are applicable as usual. The global
derivatives can be computed using the tapes created in the serial and
parallel parts of the function evaluation, where user interaction is
required for the correct derivative concatenation of the various tapes.

For the usage of the parallel facilities, the \verb=configure=-command
has to be used with the option \verb?--with-openmp-flag=FLAG?, where 
\verb=FLAG= stands for the system dependent OpenMP flag.
The parallel differentiation of a parallel program is illustrated
by the example program \verb=openmp_exam.cpp= contained in \verb=examples/additional_examples/openmp_exam=.

\section{Traceless forward differentiation in ADOL-C}
\label{tapeless}
%
Up to version 1.9.0, the development of the ADOL-C software package
was based on the decision to store all data necessary for derivative
computation on traces (tapes), where large applications require the traces to be
written out to corresponding files. In almost all cases this means
a considerable drawback in terms of run time due to the excessive
memory accesses. Using these traces enables ADOL-C to offer multiple

implementing the forward and the reverse mode.
For a certain degree {\sf deg} $\geq$ 0, the scalar version of the
forward mode involves apart from the tape buffers an array of 
 $(${\sf deg}$+1)*${\sf maxlive} {\sf double}s in
core and, in addition, a sequential data set called the value stack 
of {\sf tssize}$*${\sf keep} {\sf revreal}s if called with the 
option {\sf keep} $>$ 0. Here
the type {\sf revreal} is defined as {\sf double} or {\sf float}. The latter choice halves the storage
requirement for the sequential data set, which stays in core if
its length is less than {\sf TBUFSIZE} bytes and is otherwise written
out to a temporary file. The parameter {\sf TBUFSIZE} is defined in the header file \verb=<adolc/usrparms.h>=.

function value $F(x)$ itself, the next column represents the first
Taylor coefficient vector of $F$, and the last column the

how many Taylor coefficients of all intermediate quantities are
written into the value stack as explained in \autoref{forw_rev_ad}.
 If {\sf keep} is omitted, it defaults to 0.

The given {\sf tag} value is used by {\sf forward} to determine the

Now using the pointers in the methods {\sf setADValue} and {\sf getADValue} makes more sense since the vector mode requires the field of $p$ elements per {\sf adouble} which holds the derivative values.
Additionally, the traceless vector forward mode of ADOL-C offers two
new methods for setting/getting the derivative values. Setting a derivative value of the desired vector element is possible by passing a {\sf double} value and its position in the vector ({\sf integer}). Getting a derivative value of the desired vector element requires as argument only its position in the vector. One can note that the pointers are not used in these cases, as illustrated in the following example:
\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{l}
    {\sf adtl::setNumDir(10);}\\
    ...\\
    {\sf adouble x, y;}\\
    ...\\
    {\sf x1=2;}\\
    {\sf x1.setADValue(5,1);\hspace*{3.7cm}// set the 6th point value of x to 1.0}\\
      ...\\
    {\sf cout $<<$ y.getADValue(3) $<<$ endl;\hspace*{1cm}// print the 4th derivative value of y}

\subsection{Drivers of the Toolbox for Lie Derivatives}
Nonlinear controller and observer design often require certain types of Lie derivatives. These derivatives also arise in other areas such as classical mechanics and relativity.
Lie derivatives are total derivatives of tensor fields along a vector field.
The drivers for calculating Lie derivatives in ADOL-C presented in this section
were developed by Klaus R{\""o}benack~\cite{Roeb05} and his co-workers Jan Winkler, Siqian Wang and Mirko Franke~\cite{Roeb11}. 
They are prototyped as C functions in the header file {\verb=<adolc_lie.h>=} and
allow the calculation of Lie derivatives of scalar, vector and covector fields. In addition, the calculation of gradients of Lie derivatives of scalar fields is supported.

We consider computational problems occurring in controller and observer design for 
nonlinear control systems
\begin{equation*}
\dot{\mathbf x}=\mathbf f(\mathbf x)+\mathbf g(\mathbf x)u,
\quad \mathbf y=\mathbf h(\mathbf x),\quad \mathbf x(0)=\mathbf x_0 \in \Omega\\
\end{equation*}
with the scalar input u, the state $\mathbf x$, and the output $\mathbf y$, where the vector
fields $\mathbf f : \Omega \to \R^n$, $\mathbf g: \Omega \to \R^n$
and the map $\mathbf h: \Omega\to \R^m$ (for $m=1$ this map is the scalar field $h$) 
"
/adol-c-v2.6.3.tar.gz/ADOL-C/doc/adolc-manual.tex,CECILL-2.0,0.046551607006714665,ScoreOutOfRange,2062,2101,103140,105470,0.00032197883509150934,"Higher order Lie derivatives are given by the recursion
\[
 L_{\mathbf f}^{k+1} h(\mathbf x)= \frac{\partial L_{\mathbf f}^k h(\mathbf x)}{\partial \mathbf x}\,\mathbf f(\mathbf x)\quad\text{with}\quad L_{\mathbf f}^0 h(\mathbf x)= h(\mathbf x).
\]
To compute Lie derivatives
\[
(L_\mathbf f^0h(\mathbf x_0),\ldots,L_\mathbf f^dh(\mathbf x_0))
\]
we need the trace numbers of the active sections of the vector field~$\mathbf f$ and the scalar field~$h$, 
the number of independent variables $n$, the initial value $\mathbf x_0\in\Omega$
and the highest derivative degree $d$. The values of the Lie derivatives are 
then stored in the one dimensional array {\verb=result=} of length $d+1$:

\begin{tabbing}
\hspace{0.5in}\={\sf short int tag;} \hspace{1.1in}\= \kill    % define tab position
\>{\sf int lie\_scalarc(Tape\_F, Tape\_H, n, x0, d, result)}\\
\>{\sf short Tape\_F;}         \> // trace identification of vector field $\mathbf f$ \\
\>{\sf short Tape\_H;}         \> // trace identification of scalar field $h$\\
\>{\sf short n;}               \> // number of independent variables $n$ and $m = 1$\\
\>{\sf double x0[n];}          \> // values of independent variables $\mathbf{x}_0$\\
\>{\sf short d; }              \> // highest derivative degree $d$\\
\>{\sf double result[d+1];}    \> // resulting Lie derivatives of a scalar field\\
\end{tabbing}   


For a smooth vector-valued map $\mathbf h: \Omega\rightarrow \R^m$ with 
$\mathbf h(\mathbf x)=(h_1(\mathbf x),\ldots,h_m(\mathbf x))^T$
we define the Lie derivative
\begin{equation}\label{eq:lie_vectorial}
L_\mathbf f^k\mathbf h(\mathbf x_0)=
(L_\mathbf f^kh_1(\mathbf x_0),\ldots,L_\mathbf f^kh_m(\mathbf x_0))^T\in\R^m
 \quad \text{for}\quad k = 0, \cdots, d,
\end{equation}
component-wise by the Lie derivatives $L_\mathbf f^k h_1(\mathbf x_0),\ldots,L_\mathbf f^k h_m(\mathbf x_0)$ of the $m$ scalar fields $h_1, \ldots, h_m:\Omega\to\R$. Note that~\eqref{eq:lie_vectorial} should not be confused with the Lie derivative of a vector field. To compute Lie derivatives~\eqref{eq:lie_vectorial} of the vector-valued map $\mathbf h$
we additionally need the number of dependent variables $m$:

\begin{tabbing}
\hspace{0.5in}\={\sf short int tag;} \hspace{1.1in}\= \kill    % define tab position
\>{\sf int lie\_scalarcv(Tape\_F, Tape\_H, n, m, x0, d, result)}\\

\>{\sf short Tape\_G;}         \> // trace identification of vector field $\mathbf g$\\
\>{\sf short n;}               \> // number of independent variables $n$\\

\subsubsection*{Additional C++ Drivers for Lie Derivatives}

For Lie derivatives of scalar fields, the C interface offers two different drivers, namely {\verb=lie_scalarc=} for $m=1$ scalar field $h:\Omega\to\R$ and {\verb=lie_scalarcv=} for $m\geq1$ scalar fields $h_1,\ldots,h_m:\Omega\to\R$, which are combined in a vector-valued map $\mathbf{h}:\Omega\to\R^m$. Using the polymorphism in C++, both C drivers are unified by the C++ driver {\verb=lie_scalar=} for the computation of Lie derivatives of scalar fields:

\begin{tabbing}
\hspace{0.5in}\={\sf int lie\_scalar(Tape\_F, Tape\_H, n, x0, d, result)} \hspace{0.45in}\= // case $m=1$\\
\>{\sf int lie\_scalar(Tape\_F, Tape\_H, n, m, x0, d, result)} \> // case $m\geq1$
\end{tabbing} 

The same situation occurs with the gradients or jacobians of Lie derivatives of scalar fields. Here, the C drivers {\verb=lie_gradientc=} and {\verb=lie_gradientcv=} are unified by the C++ driver {\verb=lie_gradient=}:

\begin{tabbing}
\hspace{0.5in}\={\sf int lie\_gradient(Tape\_F, Tape\_H, n, x0, d, result)} \hspace{0.35in}\= // case $m=1$\\
\>{\sf int lie\_gradient(Tape\_F, Tape\_H, n, m, x0, d, result)} \> // case $m\geq1$
\end{tabbing} 

The C++ drivers are also prototyped in the header file {\sf $<$adolc\_lie.h$>$}. An example how to use these drivers for the calculation of Lie derivatives can be found in the file {\sf GantryCrane.cpp} in the directory {\verb=additional_examples/lie=}.

	remains uninitialized. In terms of function evaluation
	$x_1$ holds the value 2 and $x_2$ the value 4 whereas the derivative values
	are initialized to $\dot{x}_1=1$ and $\dot{x}_2=0$.
   \item Setting point values directly
         \begin{center}
	   \begin{tabular}{l}
         {\sf double seedOne = 1., seedZero = 0.;}\\
	     {\sf adouble x1=2, x2=4, y;}\\
	     ...\\
	     {\sf x1.setADValue(\&seedOne);}\\
	     {\sf x2.setADValue(\&seedZero);}
	   \end{tabular}
	 \end{center}
	 The same example as above but now using {\sf setADValue}-method for initializing the derivative values. It is important to note that in both cases the derivative values have to be set by passing an address of a variable or a pointer of the {\sf double} type (instead of passing the value directly). The reason for doing this will become clear in the next subsection.

\begin{center}

array {\sf tensor}, e.g.~by a further call of {\sf tensor\_eval}, directly effects the values accessed
